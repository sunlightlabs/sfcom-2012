The first was the explosion of social media. Increasing numbers of people were going online, not only to get and share personal information, but to connect for civic and political purposes. As people embraced new media tools and Web sites, they became accustomed to having a readily available stream of information at their fingertips. A new media ecosystem, powered by the contributions of millions of active participants (called the \"networked public sphere\") emerged alongside the older, more top-down and less participatory traditional media system.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile, trust in government was falling to another all time low. Multiple corruption scandals engulfed Washington. Super-lobbyist Jack Abramoff was pursued for putting top congressional leaders in his pocket and fleecing Indian tribes. Congressman Duke Cunningham was found accepting outlandish bribes in exchange for earmarks. One of the most ethically-challenged, and powerful members of Congress -- then Majority Leader Tom DeLay -- chose to leave office while facing rising legal problems. Amid the growing dissatisfaction with government and mindful of the changes underway in the information economy, longtime Washingtonians Michael Klein and Ellen Miller met to discuss ways to push for a more open and accountable government. Their vision: To fundamentally expand public access to vital government information for journalists and citizens alike, and to empower them with the tools to engage in online collaboration and dialog with their public officials.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nKlein was a D.C. businessman and lawyer with a strong interest in politics. Miller was a long-time public interest advocate and non-profit entrepreneur, having founded both the Center for Responsive Politics and Public Campaign. They invited two colleagues, Micah Sifry and Andrew Rasiej, co-founders of the Personal Democracy Forum, the country's leading conference on how technology is changing politics, to advise them. Their discussions led to the following decision: To create a foundation dedicated to using the revolutionary power of the Internet to make information about government more meaningful accessible to citizens.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn April 2006, the Sunlight Foundation formally opened its doors. Unlike other non-profit institutions based in Washington, DC, Sunlight sought, much like a tech start-up, to take an experimental approach to achieving its goals of making government data more available and accessible. Rather than focusing exclusively on policy work aimed at Washington insiders or grassroots engagement efforts aimed at ordinary Americans, Sunlight focused on three key priorities: digitizing data, building tools and the sites for easy access to it, and developing communities to support and help carry on its work.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSunlight's main policy priority is to establish within government an a priori assumption that all public information should be made available online, in as close to real-time as possible. In just three years, government has begun to move in this direction. The 2007 Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (<a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1/show\">HLOGA</a>) contained recommendations by Sunlight that included the online posting of paid private travel disclosures and personal financial disclosures as well as the requirement that committee meetings be made available online in video, audio or written format. Soon after the passage of HLOGA, Sunlight announced the launch of <a href=\"http://theopenhouseproject.com\">the Open House Project</a>, a collaborative cross-partisan effort (that had the public blessing of both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader John Boehner) to identify concrete reforms the House of Representatives could make in its use of information and the Internet.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSunlight's policy work has helped push many changes to fruition including updating Franking rules to allow lawmakers to use social media sites like Twitter and YouTube, getting the House and the Senate to post office expenditure reports online and roll call votes posted in .XML format. Our work has also influenced executive branch transparency efforts, including the creation of a Chief Technology Officer, the establishment of Data.gov and Recovery.gov and the Open Government Directive. Much work remains to be done, and Sunlight's current priorities include electronic filing for Senate campaign finance reports; advancement of a 72-hour \"read the bill\" rule mandating that all legislation be posted online three days before consideration; and ultimately the enactment of an omnibus <a href=\"http://publicmarkup.org/bill/transparency-government-act-2008-revised/\">Transparency in Government Act</a> that would make sweeping improvements in how Washington shares information with the public.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe creation of new databases, tools and Web sites is another priority of the Foundation. Early on, Sunlight decided to create an internal development lab staffed by top coders and designers skilled at working with the latest information technologies. Through the work of this Sunlight Labs team, terabytes of data have been digitized, and major new databases and tools have been created to share vital political information with the public. The Web sites <a href=\"http://www.capitolwords.org\">CapitolWords.org</a>, <a href=\"http://www.louisdb.org\">LOUISdb.org</a>, <a href=\"http://www.earmarkwatch.org\">EarmarkWatch.org</a>, <a href=\"http://www.politicalpartytime.org\">PoliticalPartyTime.org</a>, <a href=\"http://www.congrelate.org\">Congrelate.org</a> and <a href=\"http://www.publicmarkup.org\">PublicMarkup.org</a> are all exemplary examples of open, accessible political information tools created and supported by Sunlight.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSunlight has also funded the creation and maintenance of various Web tools and projects that create transparency and encourage citizen engagement. In this category, its flagship project is OpenCongress.org, a user-friendly hub for comprehensive information about bills, members and votes created in partnership with the Participatory Politics Foundation. OpenCongress.org is a one-of-a-kind site that attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors a month; many come to simply look up a specific piece of information, but tens of thousands have also created ongoing accounts on the site. These users track subjects they are interested in, comment on legislation, collaborate on reporting on current topics using wiki tools, and connect to like-minded users. Sunlight's funding has also helped MAPLight.org, which shows relationships between money and votes, focus on Congress; enabled OMB Watch to create FedSpending.org, the country's first searchable database of all government grants and contracts; and is now enabling the Center for Responsive Politics and the National Institute for Money in State Politics to place their vast data sets containing tens of millions of records covering decades of campaign activity at the federal and state level into an open \"Data Commons\" that will launch in early 2010.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPerhaps most importantly, at our core, Sunlight recognizes that no number of staff at Sunlight or organizations we fund will be able to accomplish the task of making government transparent and accountable alone. Consequently, Sunlight seeks, at every opportunity, to engage concerned citizens in the work of making Washington more transparent, accessible and accountable.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOur <a href=\"http://www.sunlightlabs.com\">Sunlight Labs</a> now maintains a growing list of more than 2,000 software developers and designers who volunteer time and expertise toward building a growing cyber-infrastructure in support of nationwide transparency. The Open House Project listserv has more than 750 participants who are active at all levels of opening up the data running through government with new or revised policy. And, projects like our Transparency Corps, where any citizen - regardless of their technical or political knowledge - can help with modest, repetitive tasks that produce valuable new databases or resources, are gaining more participants every day.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBeginning in 2010, Sunlight is engaging citizens nationwide in not only using new online tools to keep tabs on government and tell the stories of what's happening on Capitol Hill, but also to advocate that government information at all levels be available online and in real-time.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSunlight is funded by an array of foundations and individuals, the largest of whom are Omidyar Network and our co-founder, Michael Klein. Omidyar Network doubled its commitment to us in the last year. Sunlight is also support by the Open Society Institute, The Pew Charitable Trusts, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Rockefeller Family Fund and many individual donors.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe future holds much more for the Sunlight Foundation as the government continues to embrace transparency at a rapid pace. We hope you'll join us.\r\n</p>\r\n", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 131, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "Android App - Congress", "url": "/android/congress/", "template_name": "flatpages/full.html", "sites": [1], "content": "<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n#leftcol {\r\n  float: left;\r\n  width: 500px\r\n}\r\n#features {\r\n  float: left;\r\n  width: 430px\r\n}\r\n#reviews {\r\n  float: right;\r\n  width: 430px\r\n}\r\n\r\n#thumbs img {padding: 10px}\r\n\r\n#features li {list-style-type: disc}\r\n-->\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"leftcol\">\r\n\r\n<img style=\"margin: 6px; padding: 10px\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Android_Congress.png\" width=200 align=\"left\">\r\n\r\n<h2>Congress for your Android Phone!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>'Congress' is a free pocket directory that allows you to quickly get detailed information on your members of Congress, and what they're up to.

The refining of our message is critical and includes two primary components:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li  style=\"margin:10px 0 20px 20px;\"><p>How we speak, write and frame what we want to see in government</p></li>\r\n<li  style=\"margin:10px 0 20px 20px;\"><p>The actual priorities and policies we want to see government adopt through legislation and action</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li><p><strong>4.)</strong> Create and distribute toolkits, guides and resources to provide shared best practices and common messaging / branding as well as useful strategies and tactics.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: 470px; background-color:#eff5e6; padding:15px; border:1px solid #e5eed9; margin-bottom:230px;  font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:.9em;\">\r\n<h3>Logistics</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We're going to get all this going on a <a href=\"http://publicequalsonline.pbworks.com\">wiki</a> and <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/citizens-for-opengov\">Google Group</a> first so we can communicate openly, share ideas and get to know each other.* </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is already much to share from many of you who have stepped up. </p><p>\r\n\r\nBy March, we will launch a fully developed website to be the hub of our activity. This is where we will provide tools, resources and trainings, latest information, videos, and where we will amass the political clout we need through a well developed pledge/petition. From there, we will launch advertisements, conduct insane amounts of media outreach, and make our case to government everywhere.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWe hope to launch in full by Sunshine Week in the middle of March and host as many leaders as possible at our <a href=\"http://www.transparencycamp.org\">TransparencyCamp</a> East un-conference in Washington, DC, March 27-28.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMost importantly in this campaign is that we each take ownership of it. None of what is listed on this page will happen at all without YOU. The Sunlight Foundation and our contributors will provide the primary resources to support this campaign by helping to create the brand and provide infrastructure - such as technology, communications and policy expertise. But for this campaign to have life, your voice needs to be the driving force.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nIf you think about how far we've come since the beginning of 2009, we can't wait to see where we'll be at the beginning of 2011.\r\n </p><p>\r\n\r\n<p><small>\r\n* Many of you may already be on our Sunlight Labs list, Transparency bloggers list, or the Open House Project -- this will be a little different.

The comments of the Sunlight Foundation address the\r\n  FEC&#146;s mandate to disclose campaign finance information to the public. Outlined\r\n  below are recommendations to make the FEC Web site user-friendly; provide new\r\n  Web services; update FEC data architecture; improve electronic filing\r\n  procedures; and provide online disclosure of significant agency contacts. If\r\n  adopted, these recommendations will improve the public&#146;s knowledge of campaign\r\n  finance information. Strengthening public access to campaign finance data will\r\n  increase the scrutiny of campaign finance activities, thereby improving\r\n  compliance and enforcement of the law.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Make the FEC Web Site User-Friendly</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The FEC&#146;s Web site is the most important tool the agency has to fulfill its\r\n  mandate to publicly disclose campaign finance information. Certain aspects of\r\n  the site, such as the maps on the homepage, embrace the creative and\r\n  interesting ways the Internet can be used to inform the public. However, much\r\n  of the Web site uses technical or legal language that is difficult for the\r\n  average citizen to understand. In other cases, data is provided in cumbersome,\r\n  outmoded ways that fail to take advantage of the dynamic nature of the\r\n  Internet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The FEC should never lose sight that its Web site is supposed to provide a\r\n  gateway for curious citizens, and is not simply a resource for accountants and\r\n  lawyers already versed in the finer details of campaign finance law and\r\n  technical jargon. To improve the accessibility of its Web site, the FEC should\r\n  undertake a review of the language on the site and define, revise or rewrite\r\n  it in a manner a lay-user can understand. Legally accurate terms such as &#147;24\r\n  hour notice of disbursements/obligations for electioneering communications&#148; or\r\n  &#147;24 hour notice of independent expenditures or coordinated expenditures&#148; are\r\n  meaningless to most casual users and definitions, where provided, are often\r\n  vague and confusing. Links to plain language definitions should be provided to\r\n  make the site more accessible to casual users.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Beyond improving the language, the FEC&#146;s Web site must be structured to\r\n  incorporate the ways people have come to expect to use the Internet. A prime\r\n  example of the confusing and outmoded way the FEC site functions can be found\r\n  in the section that shows the latest electronic filings from candidates. After\r\n  selecting the candidate name, the user sees a long list of filing reports.\r\n  Selecting a report at random &mdash; for example, the latest monthly filing of\r\n  contributions &mdash; a user must choose &#147;Schedule A filings (Itemized Receipts)&#148; to\r\n  find the contributions. At that point, he or she must select from the\r\n  following choices:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  For all Line Numbers\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  For Line Number: 17A\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  For Line Number: 17C\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  For Line Number: 20A\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  For Line Number: 21\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Virtually no one other than a trained campaign worker would know that line\r\n  number 17A is the one that holds the information they want. In this day and\r\n  age, that kind of &#147;interface&#148; is not just confusing, but ludicrous. It sends\r\n  an abrupt message to the casual user that they have entered territory reserved\r\n  for experts, not lay people.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  A Web site designed for use by the public should not require that mysterious\r\n  references be deciphered or a legal dictionary at the users&#146; fingertips. Clear\r\n  definitions, plain language and intuitive use of links and other tools are the\r\n  hallmarks of a user-friendly site and should be primary considerations as the\r\n  agency undertakes a redesign of its site.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Provide New Web Services</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  At its best, the Internet allows users to add value to data available on one\r\n  site and make it available on other sites. The New York Times and\r\n  OpenSecrets.org provide users with the ability to use FEC data outside the\r\n  confines of the particular site from which it was retrieved. But, because the\r\n  FEC is the primary source for the data, and because it is the FEC&#146;s duty to\r\n  publicly disclose the data, the FEC should not leave the responsibility of\r\n  making the data usable to outside companies or not-for-profit organizations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  In particular, the FEC should provide Web services that allow data from an\r\n  official FEC search to be syndicated on other Web sites or used\r\n  programmatically by other software. All search queries should provide a\r\n  permanent RSS feed that can be used to syndicate the results to other clients.\r\n  The FEC should develop an API (Application Program Interface) that will allow\r\n  programmers to interact with FEC data. End-users of outside Web sites should\r\n  be free to use the FEC&#146;s APIs to obtain, display and reuse FEC data in their\r\n  own applications. The technologies adopted should not be complicated or\r\n  proprietary, nor should they be likely to become quickly\r\n  outdated.<sup><a class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" href=\"#sdfootnote1sym\" name=\"sdfootnote1anc\"><sup>1</sup></a></sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The FEC should also update the technology it uses for search queries so that\r\n  end users have the ability to link to search results in emails and other Web\r\n  sites.<sup><a class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" href=\"#sdfootnote2sym\" name=\"sdfootnote2anc\"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>\r\n  The ability for users to link to search results is so commonplace as to become\r\n  mundane, yet this standard feature of today&#146;s technology is not available to\r\n  someone trying to link something so fundamental as a search result on FEC\r\n  contribution data to an online article.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Improve FEC Data Architecture</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Underpinning the agency&#146;s ability to make more information public in a timely,\r\n  user friendly manner is the data architecture employed by the FEC. As the\r\n  agency looks to provide the most meaningful data to the public, it must\r\n  restructure the way the data is stored and how it flows outward. Currently,\r\n  much of the information contained in campaign finance reports is truncated or\r\n  lost by the time it reaches the public. For example, the COBOL-based official\r\n  database is published in a fixed width format, allowing for 35 characters in\r\n  the occupation/employer fields which are collapsed into one column. The result\r\n  is that occupation/employer information that is reported as &#147;Associate\r\n  Director of Mid-Atlantic Sales/Wal Mart, Stores Inc.&#148; is transformed and\r\n  reported to the public as &#147;Associate Director of Mid Atlantic.&#148; The precise\r\n  title as well as the entire employer is missing, providing little relevant\r\n  information in the public database. Over 500,000 of 2,328,000 records, or more\r\n  than 20 percent, are truncated in this manner.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Similarly, a user trying to download files of individual contributions runs\r\n  into this caveat:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The amount field is in COBOL format and may contain a special character (see\r\n  table below) if the amount is negative. To convert these to standard negative\r\n  integers you will need to replace the right most character with its associated\r\n  integer and then multiple the number by negative 1. For example, if the amount\r\n  it 20] replace the ] with 0 and to get 200. Then multiple by negative 1. The\r\n  correct amount is \u2013200.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Even someone well-versed in the intricacies of the FEC&#146;s disclosure system\r\n  will find this explanation daunting. The answer to solving this problem is to\r\n  abandon the outdated tools the FEC is currently using and to adopt a more\r\n  modern\r\n  format.<sup><a class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" href=\"#sdfootnote3sym\" name=\"sdfootnote3anc\"><sup>3</sup></a></sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The agency should also address the way it stores and manages data relating to\r\n  enforcement matters, creating a system to describe the type of violation\r\n  alleged to have occurred. Categorizing enforcement matters by issue such as\r\n  excessive contributions, contributions from foreign nationals, contributions\r\n  from a straw party, etc. would provide a structure that could then be used to\r\n  inform the public as to the type, frequency and severity of various campaign\r\n  finance violations and facilitate the use of enforcement data in innovative\r\n  ways that take advantage of Web 2.0 capabilities.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The concerns surrounding the usability of the FEC&#146;s Web site and data\r\n  architecture reflect an overarching concern that the FEC&#146;s site is not fully\r\n  integrated with the mission of the agency. In every agency, but especially\r\n  those where public disclosure is part of the agency&#146;s mission, the Web site\r\n  should be viewed as more than a place to publish data. It should be recognized\r\n  as a valuable strategic asset that is instrumental to the agency in fulfilling\r\n  its mandate. The FEC must ensure that its Web team is recognized as more than\r\n  providing a support function. Just as attorneys are essential for the FEC&#146;s\r\n  enforcement duties and accountants are critical to the FEC&#146;s compliance\r\n  mandate, the FEC&#146;s Web staff is instrumental to the core disclosure mission of\r\n  the agency and must be provided with the skills and authority to make\r\n  disclosure on its Web site equal with other core agency functions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Improve Electronic Filing Procedures</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The FEC has implemented rules to facilitate electronic filing of campaign\r\n  reports, including data formats for information such as donor name and\r\n  occupation/employer. Unfortunately, it is extremely common for report data to\r\n  be missing, incomplete or jumbled. Data that is filed in non-standardized\r\n  formats is difficult to manage, may not be accurate and must be cleaned up to\r\n  make it useful to the public.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The FEC could mitigate much of the work currently required to clean up data by\r\n  enforcing software standards more strictly and refusing to certify campaign\r\n  packages that do not comply with such standards. In specifying filing\r\n  information as well as structuring its own data, the FEC should look for\r\n  opportunities for interoperability with other government data sets, such as\r\n  the data found on FedSpending.gov and the emerging Securities and Exchange\r\n  Commission's interactive data filing\r\n  requirements.<sup><a class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" href=\"#sdfootnote4sym\" name=\"sdfootnote4anc\"><sup>4</sup></a></sup>\r\n  In pursuing interoperability, the FEC reduces the financial burden on filers\r\n  and consumers of supporting multiple, non-standard data formats.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  In addition to enforcing current electronic filing standards more stringently,\r\n  the Commission should consider expanding the number and types of documents\r\n  that are required to be filed electronically. The agency should require\r\n  electronic filing of complaints (and related documents) alleging campaign\r\n  finance irregularities. Electronic filing would facilitate prompt online\r\n  disclosure and allow the documents to be searchable by text, thus providing\r\n  the public with a more complete and accurate survey of the campaign finance\r\n  activities that are monitored and regulated by the Commission.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Provide Online Disclosure of Significant Agency Contacts </b>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <a name=\"601\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  As part of the FEC&#146;s enforcement and compliance duties, senior staff and FEC\r\n  Commissioners routinely meet with individuals representing candidates, PACs,\r\n  campaign committees, corporations or other entities that are being\r\n  investigated or have knowledge of possible alleged campaign finance\r\n  violations. To address the appearance of undue influence or corruption, the\r\n  Commission should draft regulations that would require Commissioners and\r\n  certain senior officials (defined by SES level, policy or decision making\r\n  authority, etc.) to report, online, within 72 hours, any significant contact\r\n  relating to a request for FEC action. If the Commission finds that it does not\r\n  have the ability to draft such regulations, it should design a system of\r\n  voluntary reporting of significant contacts. In either case, a &#147;significant\r\n  contact&#148; is an oral, written or electronic communication that is made to\r\n  senior FEC staff or Commissioners, that seeks to influence any official\r\n  action, including any advisory, regulatory or enforcement action pending\r\n  before the Commission.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The reports should contain the name of the FEC official, the name of each\r\n  private party who had a significant contact with that official, and a summary\r\n  of the nature of the contact, including the date of the contact, the subject\r\n  matter of the contact, and if the contact was made on behalf of a client, the\r\n  name of the client. Information that would be exempt from disclosure under\r\n  FOIA would not have to be disclosed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>The Sunlight Foundation</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The Sunlight Foundation was founded in 2006 with the non-partisan mission of\r\n  using the revolutionary power of the Internet to make information about\r\n  Congress and the federal government more meaningfully accessible to citizens.\r\n  Through our projects and grant-making, Sunlight serves as a catalyst for\r\n  greater political transparency and to foster more openness and accountability\r\n  in government. Sunlight&#146;s ultimate goal is to strengthen the relationship\r\n  between citizens and their elected officials and to foster public trust in\r\n  Congress. We are unique in that technology and the power of the Internet are\r\n  at the core of every one of our efforts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Our work is committed to helping citizens, bloggers and journalists be their\r\n  own best congressional watchdogs, by improving access to existing information\r\n  and digitizing new information, and by creating new tools and Web sites to\r\n  enable all of us to\r\n  <a href=\"http://publicmarkup.org/\"><u>collaborate</u></a>\r\n  in fostering greater transparency. Since our founding in the spring of 2006,\r\n  we have assembled and funded an array of web-based databases and tools\r\n  including\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/\"><u>OpenCongress.org</u></a>,\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.congresspedia.org/\"><u>Congresspedia.org</u></a>,\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.fedspending.org/\"><u>FedSpending.org</u></a>,\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/\"><u>OpenSecrets.org</u></a>,\r\n  <a href=\"http://earmarkwatch.org/\"><u>EarmarkWatch.org</u></a>\r\n  and\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.louisdb.org/\"><u>LOUISdb.org</u></a>.\r\n  These sites make millions of bits of information available online about the\r\n  members of Congress, their staff, legislation, federal spending and lobbyists.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  By facilitating the creation of new databases, and the maintenance and\r\n  expansion of pre-existing ones, along with the application of technologies\r\n  that free data from its silos, we have liberated gigabytes of important\r\n  political data from basements, paper, .pdfs and other non-searchable and\r\n  non-mashable formats. These efforts, combined with our own\r\n  <a href=\"http://wherearetheynow.sunlightprojects.org/\"><u>distributed\r\n  investigative research projects</u></a>, community-based engagement\r\n  with Congress to bridge its\r\n  <a href=\"http://theopenhouseproject.com/\"><u>technological\r\n  gaps</u></a> and lobbying to demand\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/reform_agenda_memo\"><u>changes</u></a>\r\n  in how and what Congress makes publicly available online, have created an\r\n  unprecedented demand for more: more information, more transparency and more\r\n  easy-to-use tools.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Underlying all of Sunlight&#146;s efforts is a fundamental belief that increased\r\n  transparency will improve the conduct of Congress itself and the public&#146;s\r\n  confidence in government.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n  <p><small>\r\n    <a class=\"sdfootnotesym\" href=\"#sdfootnote1anc\" name=\"sdfootnote1sym\">1</a> Sunlight\r\n    recommends XML and JSON as well as a REST-based API for search queries\r\n    because these technologies, along with open standards, are likely to result\r\n    in Web services are easy to consume and that will not be quickly outdated.\r\n    </small>\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p><small>\r\n    <a class=\"sdfootnotesym\" href=\"#sdfootnote2anc\" name=\"sdfootnote2sym\">2</a> The FEC currently uses an HTTP POST request.

Those generous donations \u2013 large and small \u2013 are critical in sustaining and expanding Sunlight\u2019s efforts to foster and promote greater government transparency and openness.\r\n\r\nThe following gift acceptance policy summarizes what gifts are, and are not, acceptable at Sunlight. It also enables volunteers, consultants and staff to respond to donors in a timely and consistent manner and to accommodate novel or complex donations that may require consideration of several interrelated factors. It is not a substitute for flexibility and independent judgment by the Executive Director.\r\n\r\nThis policy pertains to all cash donations of $250 or more, as well as donations of life income gifts, real estate, insurance policies, etc. Sunlight accepts gifts of cash, stock, mutual fund shares, bonds, tangible properties, and insurance policies. Sunlight reserves the right to place conditions on accepting the gift or, if it deems it necessary, to decline the gift.\r\n\r\n1. **General Gift Acceptance** Any contribution from any source in excess of $100,000 will be reviewed and approved before acceptance by the Sunlight Foundation Board of Directors.\r\n\r\n1. **Designated Support** Should a donor wish to provide designated support for a specified project, the relationship between the donor\u2019s personal views and the nature of the project requires special scrutiny to assure that there is not a conflict of interest. Approval by the Executive Director is required before any gift from an individual, foundation, or family foundation in support of a particular project can be accepted.\r\n\r\n1. **General Support**\r\n\r\n\t1. *Under $250* Sunlight accepts donations from any source under $250 as such amounts are not significant enough to be perceived as influencing, unless the Director of Development or Executive Director identifies the donation as being inappropriate.\r\n\t\r\n\t1. *$250 or more: Individuals*\r\n\t\r\n\t\t1. Any gift of $250 or more must not have nor create a conflict of interest with the mission of the Sunlight Foundation.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t1. No project support will be accepted that could potentially provide tangible benefit to the donor nor enhance his/her professional or personal interests.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t1. Any concern or question about the appropriateness of a potential donor or the source of donation will be reviewed and determined by the Director of Development and the Executive Director.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t1. *Corporations*\r\n\t\r\n\t\t1. Sunlight will only accept contracts or grants from businesses with which there is no real or perceived conflict of interest.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t2. Any concern or question about the appropriateness of a potential donor or the source of donation will be reviewed and determined by the Director of Development and the Executive Director.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t1. *Foundation Grants*\r\n\t\r\n\t\t1. Sunlight may solicit and accept donations from national, local, community, or family foundations including those directly connected to a business entity or a business/professional association.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t2. Donations from foundations with only one director shall be reviewed as if the donation came from an individual donor.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t3. Foundation donations are subject to approval by the Development Director and Executive Director.\r\n\r\n\t1. *Gifts of Stock* Publicly traded securities are sold as soon as feasible by Sunlight and are valued and acknowledged on the date the securities are irrevocably transferred to Sunlight.\r\n\r\n\t1. *Gifts of Tangible Personal Property* Personal property should not be accepted by Sunlight unless it can be disposed of quickly and has a minimum value of $5,000. A qualified appraisal must be supplied by the donor along with the gift. Final acceptance of any gift of tangible personal property will be made by the Development Director and the Executive Director.\r\n\r\n\t1. *Tangible Gifts to Staff* Any tangible gift to staff with a value of $25 or more will only be accepted if approved by the Executive Director (including meals). Such gifts will be posted on the Sunlight website.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Deferred Donations** The rules for structuring deferred gifts can often be complex. Sunlight will encourage the donor to consult his/her own legal and financial advisors so as to avoid creating any undesirable tax consequences for the donor\u2019s estate or heirs.\r\n\r\n\t1. *Bequests* In the event of an inquiry about a prospective bequest, acceptability of an existing bequest, or assets left or proposed to be left in a will may be made only in accordance with the terms outlined in the General Donations section, above.\r\n\t\r\n\t1. *Gifts of Life Insurance* Sunlight may be named as the beneficiary of life insurance or commercial annuities. Sunlight will not, however, encourage the purchase of life insurance policies to benefit its programs.\r\n\t\r\n\t1. *Donations of Retirement Plans* Sunlight may be named the beneficiary of a qualified retirement plan, an individual retirement account (IRA), and other types of retirement plans.\r\n\t\r\n\t1. *Donations of Real Estate*\r\n\t\r\n\t\t1. All donations of real estate are subject to immediate sale except in the case of a Retained Life Estate.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t1. Donations of real estate may include developed or undeveloped property.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t1. Sunlight will not accept property with multiple owners unless there is an acceptable preceding legal agreement with the other owners regarding ultimate disposition of the property.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t1. Property may be given in the following ways:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t* An outright donation of property.\r\n\t\t\t* To establish a Charitable Remainder Trust.\r\n\t\t\t* To establish a Retained Life Estate that allows the donor to live in the property during his/her lifetime. Expenses for maintenance, real estate taxes, and any property indebtedness will be paid by the donor.\r\n\t\t\t* As a bequest in a will.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t1. Sunlight will only consider donations of real estate that are above the following market values:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t* Outright donation \u2013 $50,000\r\n\t\t\t* Charitable Remainder Trust \u2013 $100,000\r\n\t\t\t* Retained Life Estate \u2013 $100,000\r\n\t\t\t* Bequest \u2013 $50,000\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t1. Donations of real estate must be reviewed prior to acceptance and will require the following documentation and information:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t* General description of the property;\r\n\t\t\t* A demonstration of clear title of ownership. No donation of real estate will be accepted until all mortgages, deeds of trust, liens and other encumbrances have been discharged;\r\n\t\t\t* Value of the property \u2013 while it is the donor\u2019s responsibility to obtain an independent appraisal of the property, Sunlight will obtain its own appraisal of the fair market value and marketability of the property. The Director of Development will inform the donor that the IRS will require an appraisal within a period that begins sixty days before the date of the donation and ends on the day before the due date (including extensions) of the federal income tax return on which the donation is first claimed as required by law; and\r\n\t\t\t* Sunlight will calculate the costs to maintain, safeguard, and insure the property (including property tax, if applicable) during the holding period.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t1. The Director of Development will prepare a written summary of the real estate donation proposal and submit that summary to the Executive Director for review. It will include:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t* A description of the property including title of ownership and tenant information, if any;\r\n\t\t\t* The proposed arrangement of the donation and its value;\r\n\t\t\t* The purpose of the donation, what program/s it will benefit, and whether it is a cash or endowment gift;\r\n\t\t\t* An estimate or appraisal of the property and the property\u2019s fair market value and marketability;\r\n\t\t\t* Expenses, encumbrances, and carrying costs prior to disposition and income potential;\r\n\t\t\t* Environmental risk assessment;\r\n\t\t\t* Zoning restrictions;\r\n\t\t\t* Any special arrangements requested by the donor; and\r\n\t\t\t* A description of the donor and any potential conflicts of interest.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t1. The donor should not engage with potential buyers of the property.\r\n\r\n1. **Cy Pres and Other Legal Settlement Awards** Sunlight may apply for and accept cy pres funds or funds from out-of-court settlements of legal disputes. Sunlight will report as directed on the use of the funds.\r\n\r\n1. **Government** Sunlight grants will only be accepted if the gift is politically neutral and is approved for acceptance by the Executive Director.\r\n\r\n1. **Transparency** Sunlight does not accept anonymous gifts over $250.", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 40, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "Privacy Policy", "url": "/legal/privacy/", "template_name": "", "sites": [1], "content": "<p>The Sunlight Foundation values your privacy.

The Sunlight Foundation supports the Public Online Information Act (POIA), legislation that embraces a new formula for transparency: public equals online. No longer will antiquated government disclosure practices bury public information in out-of-the-way offices and in outmoded formats.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPOIA requires Executive Branch agencies to publish all publicly available information on the Internet in a timely fashion and in user-friendly formats. It also creates an advisory committee to help develop government-wide Internet publication policies. Freeing government information from its paper silos provides the private sector with raw material to develop new products and services and gives the public what they need to participate in government as active and informed citizens. Establishing an advisory committee that brings all three branches of government and the private sector together to develop government-wide information best practices will improve how the government serves the American people.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPOIA has far reaching effects:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"bullets\">\r\n<li>POIA empowers government oversight and accountability by citizens, media, and government officials alike.</li>\r\n<li>POIA promotes intra-governmental coordination by bringing key players together to develop common\r\nstandards for information transmission, streamline government data collection practices, and increase the\r\nsharing of information vital to our citizens.</li>\r\n<li>POIA contributes to economic growth by helping small and large business innovate, create jobs, and\r\ncompete globally.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCIES MUST PUBLISH PUBLIC INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nPOIA requires Executive Branch agencies to publish public information on the Internet subject to limited, commonsense exceptions. It requires the government to adopt a presumption of openness and transparency. OMB\u2019s E-Government Administrator and CIOs at independent agencies are responsible for crafting regulations to implement POIA. And, the public is granted a limited private right of action (similar to that under FOIA) to guarantee that the government lives up to its transparency obligations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPOIA\u2019s scope is limited in three major ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sunrise provision: Internet disclosure of public records becomes mandatory three years after POIA\u2019s enactment, giving agencies time to prepare.</li>\r\n<li>Prospective application: Only public records generated, updated, or released after POIA\u2019s enactment must be published online, limiting the timeframe of disclosure.</li>\r\n<li>Content-based exemptions: Public records exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act may also be exempted from POIA\u2019s online publication requirement. Additional records beyond the scope of FOIA may be withheld if it is in the public\u2019s interest.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>POIA CREATES A GOVERNMENT-WIDE ADVISORY COMMITTEE</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nPOIA creates a special federal advisory committee to coordinate the development of Internet disclosure policies. These policies promote best practices generally, including data interoperability standards, and will keep the government up-to-date with new technology. The advisory committee\u2019s 19 members \u2013 six appointed by each branch of government, plus one by GSA \u2013 are drawn from the public and private sectors and serve as watchdogs, synthesizing the needs of agencies and the public and making recommendations on updating federal law.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right sub\">\r\n<a href=\"/policy/poia/\">Back to POIA</a></p>", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 64, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "Policy Success", "url": "/policy/success/", "template_name": "flatpages/policy.html", "sites": [1], "content": "<h2>Policy Successes</h2>\r\n<p>Sunlight's work with government leads to real changes in how we access public information.

The caucus boasts more than 30 members and continues to grow.  To support the goals of the caucus, Sunlight created an <a href=\"http://transparencycaucus.org/\">Advisory Committee on Transparency</a> tasked with educating Members and their staff on transparency-related issues, problems, and solutions.\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/04/21/financial-reform-bill-has-a-small-transparency-win/\">Transparency Provision Included in Final Financial Regulation Bill</a>\r\n<p>\r\nSunlight-endorsed language was included in the conference report of the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/show/\">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> that requires the disclosure of the names of all non-government members serving on any advisory, technical, or professional committee supporting the Financial Services Oversight Council.\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/05/20/electronic-filing-provision-included-in-disclose-act-a-win-for-transparency/\">Transparency Amendment Included in the DISCLOSE Act</a>\r\n<p>\r\nA Sunlight-supported amendment was successfully included in the House-passed version of the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h5175/show\">DISCLOSE Act</a> (and in the still-pending Senate version of the bill, too).  The amendment, sponsored by Representative Susan Davis, requires new disclosures to be filed electronically with the Federal Election Commission, and requires bulk access to those filings.\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/07/28/baby-steps-on-the-earmark-transparency-act/\">Earmark Transparency Act Reported Out of Senate Committee</a>\r\n<p>\r\nOn July 28, 2010, the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee held its second debate on Senator Tom Coburn's bill, <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s3335/show\">S.3335</a>, and reported the bill out of committee by a vote of 11 to 5. The bill requires Congress to establish and maintain a centralized, publicly accessible website containing all requested earmarks, a change that Sunlight has advocated. A <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h5258/show\">companion bill</a> was also simultaneously introduced in the House this May by Representatives Bill Cassidy and Jackie Speier. Sunlight provided input on the bill, largely based on the Reporting Group's <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/topics/earmarks/\">experience</a> of using earmark disclosures in its work.\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/poia/\">Public Online Information Act Introduced</a>\r\n<p>\r\nIntroduced by Representative Steve Israel in the House and Senator Jon Tester in the Senate, the Public Online Information Act (POIA) requires executive branch agencies to publish all publicly available information on the Internet in a timely fashion and in user-friendly formats. It also creates an independent, bipartisan advisory committee to help develop government-wide Internet publication policies. POIA grew from Sunlight's reform agenda, and also from Senior Technology Consultant Andrew Rasiej's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uEQL93MJAQ#t=22m48s\">panel</a> at the Personal Democracy Forum in 2009.\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/03/25/rep-quigley-introduces-the-transparency-in-government-act-you-helped-make-it-happen/\">Transparency in Government Act Introduced</a>\r\n<p>\r\nSunlight has long supported the passage of an omnibus transparency bill. The Transparency in Government Act, sponsored by Representative Mike Quigley, updates current congressional disclosure requirements to make more information about lawmakers and lobbyists, congressional staff, and the executive branch meaningfully accessible to the public, with an emphasis on digitizing and publishing congressional information online. This bill builds on the Transparency in Government Act created by the Sunlight Foundation in 2008, and refined through the site <a href=\"http://www.publicmarkup.org/\">PublicMarkup.org</a>, where comments and responses were added directly to the bill.\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/10/03/web-use-reform-happy-ending/\">House and Senate Franking Rules Changed</a>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, the Open House Project proposed the loosening of rules governing what lawmakers can post to their official web sites. In September of 2008, the Senate Committe on Rules and Administration <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/09/24/senate-changes-franking-rules-for-web-sites/#comments\">approved new rules</a> to allow lawmakers to post content from third party sites such as YouTube, Flickr, Twitter, and others.

Click image for full visualization.</em></p>\r\n<p>As the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Max Baucus is at the center of the congressional effort to craft health care reform legislation, a top priority of President Barack Obama. The Baucus-headed Finance Committee has been singled out by advocates and news organizations as the toughest obstacle for the President&#8217;s health care priorities. Containing more moderate and conservative members may not be the only reason. The committee is packed with lawmakers who have close ties to the health care and insurance industries, receiving large campaign contributions as their former staffers turn around to lobby for the very interests whose issues &#8212; in this case health care &#8212; they previously worked on. Baucus, as chair, stands out in particular.</p>\r\n<p>Lobbying disclosure filings for the first quarter of 2009 reveal that five of Baucus&#8217; former staffers currently work for a total of twenty-seven different organizations that are either in the health care or insurance sector or have a noted interest in the outcome. The organizations represented include some of the top lobbying organizations in the health sector: Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Researchers of America (PhRMA), America&#8217;s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), Amgen, and GE Health Care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former staffers turned lobbyists include two former chiefs of staff, David Castagnetti and Jeff Forbes, and one former legislative assistant, Scott Olsen. Other former staffers working with health care portfolios include Angela Hoffman and Roger Blauwet.</p>\r\n<p>The overall health and insurance sectors haven&#8217;t just been kind to Baucus&#8217; staffers, but they&#8217;ve also aided his campaigns handsomely over the years, especially in his barely contested 2008 reelection campaign. In 2008, Baucus received $1,148,775 from the health sector and $285,850 from the insurance sector. For his career he has received $2,797,381 from the health sector and $1,170,313 from the insurance sector.</p>\r\n<p>The accompanying visualization shows the connections from Baucus to his staffers-turned-lobbyists to their health care sector clients, which, in some cases, overlap. Most of the organizations are directly involved in the health care or insurance industries. A couple, the Business Roundtable and Wal-Mart, may seem to fall outside of the realm of health care, however both are playing key roles. The Business Roundatble is <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2009/db20090312_554568.htm\">lobbying heavily</a> on the issue and Wal-Mart is a big seller of prescription medications and has a large stake in the outcome.</p>\r\n<p>All data comes from <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/\">OpenSecrets.org</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"democrats\"></a>\r\n<h4 class=\"flatpages\">2.) Senate Finance Committee Health Care Influence Cluster: The Democrats</h4>\r\n<p>(original blog post is <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/06/29/senate-finance-committee-health-care-influence-cluster-the-democrats/\">available here</a>)</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/06/22/the-max-baucus-health-care-lobbyist-complex/\">Last week</a>, I took a look at the <a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/infographics/finance_committee/baucus_sfc_health.html\">circle of former staffers</a> turned health care lobbyists that surround Senate Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus. The Senate Finance Committee is one of the two central committees in the Senate charged with formulating health care reform legislation. Knowing the connections to the health care lobby of all committee members provides us with a glimpse into whom may have access to shape the forthcoming legislation. In continuing with mapping Baucus&#8217; connections, below you&#8217;ll find a map of all the committee Democrats and their connections, through former staffers turned health care lobbyists, to various health care lobbies:</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/infographics/finance_committee/map/dems_plus_data.html\" width=\"550\" height=\"350\" border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/infographics/finance_committee/map/index.html\">map</a> shows only ten of the thirteen committee Democrats, as OpenSecrets.org does not report any staffers turned health care lobbyists for Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Jeff Bingaman or Bill Nelson. These ten Democrats are connected to a total of 20 former staffers turned health care lobbyists. Sen. Baucus leads all of the committee Democrats with five health care lobbyist connections and Sen. Chuck Schumer and Tom Carper both have three connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These 20 staffers represent approximately 91 different organizations, often overlapping in the clients they handle. The overlap usually occurs when the health care lobbyists are employed at the same firm. This can be seen clearly with David Castagnetti, Sen. Baucus&#8217; former chief of staff, and Kelly Bingel, Sen. Blanche Lincoln&#8217;s former chief of staff. Both Castagnetti and Bingel work for Mehlmen Vogel Castagnetti Inc. and handle nearly all the same clients.</p>\r\n<p>The organizations represented by these 20 health care lobbyists include some of the biggest opponents to center piece of President Obama&#8217;s health care plan: the public option. These include the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, PhRMA, and various pharmaceutical, medical device and insurance companies. The Senate Finance Committee is seen as the biggest obstacle to the public option.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to money from the health care and insurance industries, Sen. John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee for president, leads the pack. For senators who have not run for the presidency, which requires raising exhorbitant amounts of money, Sen. Baucus is ahead of other committee Democrats with Sens. Schumer and Kent Conrad following close behind.

The Senate Finance Committee has emerged as the key congressional committee in the debate over President Obama&#8217;s promised health care reform legislation. The committee is also packed with members with tight ties to the health care industry. By revealing the former staffers of Finance Committee members who have become lobbyists for the health care industry, we can show how close these connections are. Previously, visualizations were created highlighting <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/06/22/the-max-baucus-health-care-lobbyist-complex/\">Senate Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/06/29/senate-finance-committee-health-care-influence-cluster-the-democrats/\">the Democrats on the committee</a>.

OpenSecrets.org does not report any staffers turned health care lobbyists for Sen. John Cornyn. These nine Republicans are connected to 22 different health care lobbyists.</p>\r\n<p>Both Sens. Charles Grassley and Orrin Hatch have four connections to former staffers. Both senators are in powerful positions on the committee, especially as it pertains to health care legislation. Grassley is the current ranking member on the full committee and Hatch is the ranking member on the Health subcommittee. Both are also top recipients of money from the health and insurance industries. Over his career, Grassley received $1,876,479 from the health industry and $858,224 from the insurance industry. Hatch, meanwhile, pulled in $2,311,744 from the health industry and $659,307 from the insurance industry over his career.</p>\r\n<p>These 22 lobbyists represent over 100 different health care organizations. Unlike with some of the lobbyists connected to committee Democrats, there is little overlap in clients. It appears that most of these staffers turned lobbyists have their own unique portfolios.</p>\r\n<p>As with former staffers on the Democratic side, these lobbyists represent some of the top health care organizations lobbying in Washington.

Key Democrat in Health Care Talks Receives Large Health Industry Contributions in 2009</h4>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>(original blog post is <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/09/02/key-democrat-in-health-care-receives-most-health-industry-contributions-in-2009/\">available here</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the summer of the Democrats&#8217; discontent winds to a close, the head count for health care reform in the Senate begins in earnest. One of the key Democratic senators on the fence is Sen. Blanche Lincoln, a member of the Senate Finance Committee and one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the 2010 election. Lincoln jumped into the news today with a quote to a reporter stating her <a href=\"http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/lincoln-i-would-not-suport-a-solely-government-funded-public-option.php\">opposition to a public option plan</a> in a health care reform bill. &#8220;I would not support a solely government-funded public option. We can&#8217;t afford that,&#8221; Lincoln said. The senior Arkansas senator is also the 2nd highest recipient of campaign contributions from the health industry among senators this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Lincoln has received $325,350 in contributions from the health industry, as of June 30. The large amount in contributions underlies a <a href=\"http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/07/amid-pressure-from-party-leaders-and-reformers-blanche-lincoln-now-open-to-a-public-option.php\">constantly</a> <a href=\"http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/lincoln-i-would-not-suport-a-solely-government-funded-public-option.php\">shifting position</a> by the senator on health care reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/infographics/finance_committee/lincoln.html\"><img src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/infographics/finance_committee/blanche_lincoln_healthcare_crop.png\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\" class=\"aligncenter\"></a>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>One of Lincoln&#8217;s biggest contributors this cycle is the insurance giant Blue Cross Blue Shield. The company&#8217;s political action committee and employees have combined to give the senator $29,500 this year alone. Blue Cross Blue Shield and their parent company Wellpoint are vocal opponents of the inclusion of a public option plan in any health care reform bill. Blue Cross Blue Shield is the dominant insurer in Arkansas holding a 75 percent market share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blue Cross Blue Shield does not need to only rely on campaign contributions to reach Sen. Lincoln, as they retain Lincoln&#8217;s former top health care policy adviser as a lobbyist. Elizabeth Barnett worked for Lincoln from 2000 to 2007 before leaving to become the top Democratic lobbyist for Blue Cross Blue Shield. Earlier this year, Barnett left Blue Cross to work for Avenue Solutions, where she retains Blue Cross Blue Shield as a client. Avenue Solutions&#8217; profile of Barnett notes that she &#8220;had primary responsibility for representing [Blue Cross Blue Shield] and its 39 member plans before the Senate Finance Committee, Senate Democratic Leadership, and other key Senate committees and offices.&#8221; Barnett also represents other health industry organizations including UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, Bravo Health, Healthcare Leadership Council, Medco and the National Health Policy Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barnett is not the only former Lincoln staffer working as a lobbyist for the health industry. Lincoln&#8217;s former chief of staff Kelly Bingel is a lobbyist specializing in health care at Mehlman Vogel Castagnetti Inc, the lobbying firm of Sen. Max Baucus&#8217; former chief of staff David Castagnetti. Bingel represents a who&#8217;s who of the health care industry including America&#8217;s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) and Pharmaceutical Researchers &amp; Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). AHIP and PhRMA have been largely supportive of health care reform this year. PhRMA, in particular, has supported the current legislation with positive advertising after receiving concessions from the White House and the Senate Finance Committee. Bingel also represents the Business Roundtable, a group that has voiced opposition to health care reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout this year, Lincoln has benefited from <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/pol/N00008092/\">countless fundraisers</a> thrown by lobbyists. The <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/\">Party Time</a> database lists <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/12850/\">one fundraiser</a> thrown by health care lobbyists for Lincoln. On July 24, Ernst &amp; Young feted Lincoln with a fundraiser hosted by health care lobbyists Nick Giordano (formerly of Sen. Baucus&#8217; staff), Dick Meltzer (since moved on to Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s staff), LaBrenda Garrett-Nelson, Holly Bode, Francis Grab, Dave Koshgarian and Jeff Petrich. Contributions from this fundraiser will not be publicly available until the third quarter finance reports are filed.</p>\r\n", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 59, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "Project: Heart of the Matter", "url": "/projects/2009/heart_of_the_matter/", "template_name": "flatpages/full_white.html", "sites": [1], "content": "<div id=\"heart_matter\">\t\r\n <div id=\"intro\" class=\"heart_left_content\">\r\n\t<div id=\"heart_link_block_box\"><a href=\"./\"><span class=\"heart_link_block\">&nbsp;</span></a></div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"intro_graph\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn June 2008, Bray Patrick-Lake, a mother of two and director of a Colorado nonprofit serving the homeless, volunteered for a clinical trial, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, to test a medical device designed to close a hole in her heart and, in doing so, put an end the migraine headaches that were ruining her life.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThree months after she joined the study&mdash;which required passing through a surgical procedure to receive the device (though like all participants, she would be unsure whether or not she actually had received it), the device manufacturer, St. Jude Medical Inc., terminated the study. The company stated it had been unable to find enough volunteers for the trial.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause trade associations including AdvaMed, which represents firms like&mdash;and including&mdash;St. Jude Medical, lobbied Congress to oppose a provision their members didn&#8217;t like, and because the House had only one hour to read the final version of the 422-page bill before floor debate and a vote was scheduled, Patrick-Lake&mdash;and the rest of us&mdash;are unable to find out what the company found out when conducting research on the implant.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDid the device alleviate migraines in test subjects? Did any test subjects report side effects? Is the device that was implanted in Patrick-Lake&#8217;s heart a boon or an extraneous foreign body? Right now, she has no way of knowing. While she considers herself cured of her migraines, further tests showed that the device (which she did receive) had not completely closed the hole in heart, leaving her vulnerable to strokes. To remove the device would require open heart surgery.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the lobbyists and members of Congress, it was business as usual in Washington. The lobbyists got a few phrases changed in a lengthy bill&mdash;phrases that would have required public access to results of clinical trials that did not lead to an approved medical device or drug. Members of the House and Senate rushed to vote on the bill with little time to note the change. For Patrick-Lake, Washington&#8217;s standard operating procedures have left her&mdash;and the public--in the dark about the device in her heart.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is true for Patrick-Lake is true for the thousands of people who volunteer for studies of drugs or medical devices every year that companies for one reason or another do not bring to market. What industry claims is proprietary information could be useful to doctors and patients as they decide what sort of treatment is best for any number of conditions. As Steven Nissen, chairman of the cardiology department at the Cleveland Clinic, says, &#8220;If you expose human beings to an experimental treatment, the public has a fundamental right to see the results of those experiments.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/projects/heart_matter/video.htm?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=310&width=390\" title=\"The Heart of the Matter\" class=\"thickbox\">Watch the video</a> and read the profiles of the players, and see what happens to an ordinary American when K Street and Congress conspire to keep Americans in the dark.

It was Christmas time, and she was at the shopping mall with her 18-month-old son in his stroller. Suddenly, the whole right side of her body became paralyzed and she was unable to speak. That lasted about ten minutes&mdash;and then she got a really bad headache.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShe&#8217;d been sick off and on during the whole pregnancy. But she wasn&#8217;t sure what it was&mdash;pregnancy can bring on all sorts of symptoms. After the incident at the mall, however, her obstetrician sent her to a neurologist. She went through test after test, and then, finally, she got the diagnosis. And suddenly, all those headaches that she&#8217;d suffered over the previous two decades&mdash;headaches she&#8217;d written off to her sinuses or the occasional hangover&mdash;made a lot more sense.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile she was pregnant, there wasn&#8217;t much the doctors could do for her. She couldn&#8217;t go on heavy medications for fear it would harm her developing baby. After the baby arrived, she nursed her son for 13 months, so she still couldn&#8217;t go on medication because it might seep into her breast milk.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHer symptoms continued. She would slur her words, or one side of her body would get heavy. She kept getting migraines. Finally she reached the point where she was suffering from about 14 attacks a month. &#8220;A day didn&#8217;t go by where I didn&#8217;t have some kind of symptom,&#8221; she said. But Patrick-Lake, an athlete who rock climbed competitively and had lettered in four sports in school, just powered through it.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen she was finally able to start medications, she quickly discovered she couldn&#8217;t tolerate them. &#8220;They worked on my migraine, but they turned my life upside down,&#8221; she said. She&#8217;d get fits of insomnia, crying jags. She lost 20 pounds in 12 weeks. Her hair fell out. When she drove her kids to school, she&#8217;d find herself taking the wrong road. It affected her work, as director of a nonprofit serving the homeless in Longmont, Colo.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPretty soon she was seeing a full roster of medical professionals, because nobody knew quite how to classify her. She saw a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a primary care doctor.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShe got passed around. An echocardiogram showed that she had a common heart abnormality called a patent foramen ovale (PFO)&mdash;a small hole in the heart. In utero, all fetuses have this condition, which diverts blood away from undeveloped lungs, but the hole usually closes after birth. It&#8217;s estimated that as many as one in four people may have PFOs, but in most people the condition is considered to be <a href=\"http://www.aboutmigraines.com/reference/headache-news/press-releases.asp?127\">benign</a>. However, recent research that shows that <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/news/20090216/closing-a-heart-hole-may-help-migraines\">PFOs may be linked to migraines</a> for at least some people.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tExasperated, she took to the Internet and started researching. That&#8217;s how she discovered that St. Jude Medical was conducting a <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00267371?term=st+jude+escape&amp;rank=1\">clinical trial</a> for its <a href=\"http://www.sjmprofessional.com/Products/Intl/Minimally-Invasive-Structural-Heart/Premere-PFO-Closure-System.aspx\">Premere PFO closure</a> device, which was already on the market in Europe but had yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;I could have spent $10,000 and gotten one of these devices outside the country, or I could participate in a clinical trial,&#8221; said Patrick-Lake. &#8220;Part of me felt that this should be studied, that if I went through this that other people wouldn&#8217;t have to suffer.&#8221; By participating in the trial, she would also receive the device free of charge.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPatrick-Lake officially enrolled in the study on May 26, 2008. The qualification process had been extremely stringent. She had to prove that she&#8217;d failed all other treatment for migraines. She had to keep a diary of her migraines for 30 days. She had to repeat cardiac testing to show that she, indeed, suffered from a PFO.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOn June 24, 2008, she underwent a <a href=\"http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4491\">heart catheterization</a>, in which a small plastic tube was inserted into one of her arteries and was pushed up into her heart. She was participating in a &#8220;double-blind&#8221; study, designed so that neither her doctors nor she would know whether she actually received the device. She did know that two-thirds of the study participants would receive the device, one-third would not&mdash;and that she wouldn&#8217;t find out which group she was in for a full year. Getting this implant was serious business. If a patient were ever to need it removed, she would need to undergo open heart surgery.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the months that followed, Patrick-Lake did get some relief from her migraines. She also suffered some side effects. She developed an enormous bruise from the catheterization procedure, suffered from heart palpitations and chest pains, and developed drug-induced hepatitis presumably from the clot preventing drug Plavix that she was required to take. But she was still happy. &#8220;I would take chest pain and palpitations any day over my migraines,&#8221; she says.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tJust three months after Patrick-Lake had the Premere device implanted, in September 2008, St. Jude Medical announced it was canceling the trial, because, the company said, it could not recruit enough patients. (The entry on Clinicaltrials.gov, the government Web site that informs the public of ongoing research into medical devices and drugs, has <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00267371?term=st+jude+escape&amp;rank=1\">yet to be updated</a> to note this fact.)\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;I found out from the Internet,&#8221; she said, rather than through any official notification. &#8220;It sent me on such a loop&mdash;there were so many emotions. Nobody told me, and I have this device in my body for the rest of my life. It was scary because I knew it was an investigational device.&#8221; Patrick-Lake said when she followed up with her trial contacts, they said they were going to notify her at her next regular follow up appointment. She never did receive any official letter from St. Jude about the trial cancellation.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShe always strongly suspected she had the device&mdash;she says she can actually feel it in her body&mdash;but she didn&#8217;t find out officially until six months after her heart catheterization procedure, in November 2008. (She was &#8220;unblinded&#8221; after six months instead of one year because of the complications she&#8217;d been suffering.)\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile Patrick-Lake believes the Premere implant cured her migraines, she also found out that it did not close the hole in her heart completely. This means she&#8217;s still considered a high risk for strokes. And among the trial participants she found through Internet chat rooms and sites, some had problems after being implanted with the device.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShe wonders if St. Jude knows of problems with the device that the company is not revealing. But she has no way of finding out. &#8220;I think I have the right to know that,&#8221; she says. It upset her to find that because the trial was cancelled, St. Jude Medical was not required to release trial results to her or to anybody else. &#8220;To provide for my own best care in the future, I should know everything about this device and be able to share that with my doctor.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;Science needs patients and patients need science,&#8221; says Patrick-Lake, who wants to make clear that she&#8217;s a strong proponent of clinical trials. &#8220;But patient care and safety must come first.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPatrick-Lake was shocked to find out later that in 2007, the year before she joined the trial, Congress had considered&mdash;and then, under the influence of lobbyists&mdash;rejected&mdash;a requirement that would have required companies to disclose data for products that don&#8217;t make it to market. When she found out the text of the final bill was <a href=\"http://readthebill.org/cases/drugsafety/\">available for just one hour</a> before Congress debated it, she was outraged.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;Patients didn&#8217;t have a fighting chance,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This bill was being debated and there was only one hour to respond? What could I possibly do about that? I live in Colorado. It&#8217;s stunning that this could happen.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNow Patrick-Lake has become an advocate for patient rights.

Another company, Velocimed LLC, actually developed the Premere implant; St. Jude Medical <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73836&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=675070&highlight=\">acquired</a> that firm in February 2005 for $82.5 million.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThough the <a href=\"http://www.premereformfunction.com/\">Premere</a> still needed the approval of the Food and Drug Administration before it could be sold in the United States when St. Jude Medical acquired Velocimed, the company believed that the device would be a money maker. In Sept. 2005, John Heinmiller, the company&#8217;s CFO and treasurer, told potential investors at a health care conference hosted by Bear Stearns that the implant was an important part of its long-term strategy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prospects for Premere looked good. The previous May, the company <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73836&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=712582&highlight=\">launched</a> it and two other new cardiology devices in Europe. And in August, about a month before Heinmiller&#8217;s remarks, the FDA approved St. Jude Medical&#8217;s request to begin enrolling patients in its <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73836&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=749075&highlight=\">ESCAPE trial</a> for suffers of extreme migraines, which would determine whether the device could help sufferers of migraine headaches.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe company initially announced that the ESCAPE trial would be complete by 2007. However, in September 2008, St. Jude Medical stopped enrollment in the ESCAPE study, a company representative said, after concluding that it would not recruit enough participants to complete the trial until 2016.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe following month, in October 2008, chief executive officer Dan Starks told investors that the ESCAPE migraine trial was closed because of difficulty in enrolling enough patients&mdash;only 50 had signed up. While &#8220;the space&#8221; of exploring PFO closure for migraine treatment &#8220;remains of interest,&#8221; he said, the regulatory requirements for enrolling patients in the study proved too great. Apparently the company found it difficult to recruit patients under the stringent study design, which required patients to undergo extensive testing and agree to a trial where they had a two-out-of-three chance of receiving the device.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;It&#8217;s not something that we&#8217;ve referred to for some time as one of our growth drivers and it would be appropriate to take it off the list of our growth drivers that we're particularly excited about,&#8221; he told investors on a third quarter earnings conference call in 2008.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA company representative later stated that the company has no intention of re-opening the study. Meanwhile, the information collected in that study from participants such as Bray Patrick-Lake remain the property of the company.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the Premere device never won FDA approval for treatment of migraines, St. Jude Medical continues to sell and profit from the device in Europe.

Those two committees had primary responsibility for drafting and debating the reauthorization bill that sought to bring greater transparency to clinical trial data, called the Medical Device User Fee Amendments Act.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe drug and device manufacturers also had a few hundred lobbyists in their employ. The three main trade associations for these interests&mdash;the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of America, the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), and the Medical Device Manufacturers Association&mdash;had by themselves hired nearly 200 lobbyists.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A provision in the House version of the bill that would have made results from terminated clinical trials public was eliminated. But sadly, there is no federal lobbying disclosure that reveals whether a particular lobbyist or group of lobbyists had an impact on the language on clinical trial data that ended up in the final bill. According to sources who helped draft the House version of the bill, key negotiators agreed to drop the provision concerning the unapproved device's data.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo disclosure tells us whether lobbyists for AdvaMed, PhRMA or the Medical Device Manufacturers Association contacted members of the conference committee who settled on the bills final language.

Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., introduced <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1082/show\">S. 1082</a>, the Medical Device User Fee Amendments Act, directed toward a prosaic end: the bill would reauthorize fees that drug and medical device manufacturers pay that fund the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s work. Without the reauthorization, the fees would expire, and Congress would have to find some other source of funding for the FDA.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReauthorizations are typically not controversial measures, but by 2007, growing public and congressional concern stemming from a series of high profile drugs that proved dangerous despite winning FDA approval made the reauthorization bill the subject of greater scrutiny. Vioxx, developed by Merck as the next new wonder pain relief drug, was found to increase the incidence of heart attacks among users and removed from the market in 2004. That same year, the first of several studies found a link between youth suicides and common antidepressants like Paxil, made by GlaxoSmithKline, and Zoloft, sold by Pfizer.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn 2004, <a href=\"http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/hearing111804.htm\">Congress held hearings</a> on these approved drugs that had deadly consequences, excoriating the companies involved and the FDA for ignoring the danger signals revealed from clinical trials and other evidence. And in 2006, the General Accounting Office, Congress&#8217; investigative arm, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06402.pdf\">published a report</a> highlighting systemic problems in the FDA&#8217;s ability to respond to dangers caused by approved drugs.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reauthorization legislation in 2007 became a vehicle for addressing some of these wrongs. Among the remedies proposed was more transparency, which Kennedy highlighted on the Senate floor:\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;In many cases, companies have hidden evidence of safety problems. Our bill addresses this abuse by including a public database of all clinical trials and their results. Listen to that: all clinical trials and their results. We protect the trademark aspects of the particular item but require the publication of all clinical trials and their results. A company will no longer be able to hide the results if they do not show what the company wanted.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA government Web site called <a href=\"http://ClinicalTrials.gov\">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> had been posting ongoing clinical trials by companies seeking FDA approval for drugs or medical devices meant to treat &#8220;serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions&#8221; since 1997.  However, that site only provided lists of <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126838.pdf\">ongoing trials</a>.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1082/show\">Senate legislation</a> required that companies report the results of their clinical trials when they were finished, provided that the drugs or devices received FDA approval.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the House, however, lawmakers took a different approach to the clinical trials database. Like its Senate counterpart, the House version of the bill, <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h2900/show\">H.R. 2900</a>, included language that made more information available on clinical trials, including the publication of results from these trials. But the House bill specifically stated that the results must be made available to the public whether or not the drug or device being tested had been approved by the FDA.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tConsumer advocates argued that it was important to inform patients of results of trials even for products that are not approved. &#8220;If you expose human beings to an experimental treatment, the public has a fundamental right to see the results of those experiments,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the cardiology department at the Cleveland Clinic, who helped develop the House proposal.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMedical device and drug manufacturers far preferred the Senate version, arguing that publishing information about products that had not received approval could hurt their bottom line. &#8220;The current language\u2026would harm device innovation without any benefit to patients,&#8221; testified Stephen J. Ubl, president and CEO of the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), &#8220;When there is no FDA-approved product, information related to the device design and to the design of the trial and its endpoints is the only intellectual property a company may have.

On July 11, the House passed its version of the bill&mdash;including the broader transparency requirement&mdash;by a vote of 403 to 16. Then the bill sat. And sat. Meanwhile, lobbyists for interests opposed to the transparency provision, including a trade group that included St. Jude Medical Inc. among its members, pushed their point of view. [See &#8220;<a href=\"#lobbyists\">The Lobbyists</a>&#8221;]\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe bill sat in limbo until September, when Congress faced a crucial deadline. The user fee provisions in the law were about to run out, and unless Congress reauthorized them&mdash;that is, passed the new version of the bill&mdash;by the end of the month, the FDA couldn&#8217;t collect from drug and device makers the funding it needed to continue its safety reviews of drugs and medical devices.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOn September 19, a new version of <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h3580/show\">the bill</a> emerged, some 422 pages long. The bill was available for just <a href=\"http://readthebill.org/cases/drugsafety/\">one hour</a> before House members began debate. The House voted 405 to 7 to approve it, and the Senate followed suit the next day, passing it by unanimous consent.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe House language, which would have required that results data for unapproved products be made available, was gone. The new language looked a lot more like the Senate version&mdash;except now there was explicit language about &#8220;unapproved products.&#8221; According to the bill, it would be up to federal agencies to determine through regulations whether any data would be made available for products that are not approved by the FDA.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to sources who helped draft the House version of the bill, key negotiators agreed to drop the provision concerning the unapproved devices data. When the final language went to the full House, there was only an hour to review it before the debate; no member objected to the change.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the question of who should have access to data collected from patients participating in terminated clinical trials is still being raised.

However, sometimes crucial data collected along the way that could save or improve lives are not made public. The thousands of people who volunteer their bodies for clinical trials are literally left in the dark, as are the doctors who must make decisions about how to treat their patients.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople choose to enroll in clinical trials in the hope of finding some relief from severe pain or a bit of hope in warding off a deadly illness. At such a vulnerable moment, they may not always check all the fine print when they sign the papers to join a study, and often are not aware of all the ramifications involved in the byzantine agency drug and medical device approval process.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile researchers are supposed to notify patients if there are any dangers that emerge in studying a device or drug, and are obliged to follow patients who participate all the way through a trial, companies do not always live up to this.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor example, in 2007, the FDA sent a warning to Boston Scientific after investigators discovered that the company stopped following up with patients implanted with an experimental stent meant to prevent rupturing in aneurysms. The company, which stopped studying the product after finding out it frequently fractured, did not tell patients about the full scope of the problem, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/business/30device.html?pagewanted=all\">New York Times reported</a>. For patients who participate in medical device trials, lacking this information is particularly disturbing&mdash;after all, they have these devices implanted in their bodies indefinitely.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe agency suffers from severe shortcomings in following up on medical devices after they reach the market place, according to June 2009 testimony by <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09370t.pdf\">Marcia Crosse</a> of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) before a Congressional committee. While the number of &#8220;adverse events&#8221; associated with medical devices has increased substantially in recent years, the FDA lacks the resources to review all the submitted reports in a timely manner, &#8220; she said. &#8220;FDA officials told us that while they have a number of strategies to prioritize their reviews of adverse event reports, they still cannot review all the reports they receive.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOften clinical data collected for devices or drugs that don&#8217;t make to the market could provide crucial information&mdash;however, this information is not made generally available to the public.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor example, ciglatazone, a drug that was the first in a particular class of drugs developed to treat diabetes, was shown to cause liver damage in clinical trials, and never reached the market. Another drug from the same class, troglitazone, received approval. Later it was also found to cause liver damage. The data from these trials was not made public.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;Knowing the adverse event profile of ciglitazone and others in the class, might have cued clinicians and drug safety experts to look earlier and more closely for these adverse events,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#documentDetail?R=0900006480a063dd\">wrote Allan Coukell</a> a pharmacist and director of the Pew Prescription Project, in recent comments to the NIH.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is no requirement that a company or the FDA release information about clinical trials if the drug or medical device in question is not approved for the market place. <a href=\"#congress\">Congress</a> considered such a requirement in 2007, when passing a law reauthorizing industry user fees that help fund the agency&#8217;s work, but dropped it under heavy lobbying by the drug and medical device industries.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMedical device process\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow risky is the medical device?

The audit should focus on providing a comprehensive inventory of all data collected by the agency, agency engagement online and electronic record-keeping practices. Since publicizing ethics data promotes trust in government, and transaction-level details allow for citizens to participate in and oversee government's work, we believe special consideration should be given to two\r\ncategories of agency information:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEthics and Influence Data: campaign contributions, earmarks, lobbying\r\nrecords, personal financial disclosure statements, oversight information\r\nand ethics waivers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTransaction Level Details on Government Operations: schedules, meetings,\r\ntestimony, reports, grants and contracts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Data Handling</h5>\r\n<p>Agency databases should serve as the platform on which agencies function, and public access to data is only possible if agencies design their databases with specific outcomes in mind. The processes used to gather, organize and transmit data within agencies, and to the public online, should be examined and upgraded, to increase the reach of vital government information.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPaper-based processes should be digitized.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nElectronic reporting systems should be devised for all filings and the information should be fed directly into online databases.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCoordinated metadata standards must be developed to allow for interoperability of all databases within an agency or department, and throughout the government as a whole.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nApplication Programming Interfaces (APIs) and bulk data access must be implemented across all data sets, to allow for advanced analysis and programming.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Eight Open Government Data Principles should be implemented, making all government data: complete, primary, timely, accessible, machine processable, non-discriminatory, non-proprietary and license-free.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Electronic Recordkeeping</h5>\r\n<p>\r\nThe official records created by agency employees are the foundation for public information, digital preservation and the operations of each agency. Electronic recordkeeping standards and enforcement have been largely ignored, even as agencies increasingly rely on a growing amount of electronic documents. New standards and enforcement should be developed to govern electronic records management throughout their life cycle.  A rich public record depends on well handled public records and data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Agency Engagement Online</h5>\r\n<p>\r\nAgencies' Web presence should be considered a strategy for achieving agency goals and to enhance transparency\u2014not just an extension of the communications department. Agencies should consider public interaction and online collaboration as potential strategies for all agency initiatives. Agencies should adopt transparent practices for all agency operations, and this should be pursued in both agency Web sites and in non-agency communities online, where social networks hold immense and largely untapped potential.  Public meetings should be broadcast online, and information regarding agencies' daily operations should also be accessible through the Internet.*\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nResources:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://resource.org/8_principles.html\">Open Government Data Principles</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.usa.gov/webcontent/documents/Federal_Web_Managers_WhitePaper.pdf\">Web 2.0 and Government</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.openthegovernment.org/otg/Managing%20The%20Public%27s%20Records%20.pdf\">Electronic Recordkeeping Report from OpentheGovernment.org</a>\r\n</p>", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 89, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "Project: House Expenditure Reports Database", "url": "/projects/expenditures/", "template_name": "flatpages/full.html", "sites": [1], "content": "<h2>House Expenditure Reports Database</h2>\r\n<p>Ever wonder what newspapers your representative in the House subscribes to?

The company stated it had been unable to find enough volunteers for the trial.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause trade associations including AdvaMed, which represents firms like&mdash;and including&mdash;St. Jude Medical, lobbied Congress to oppose a provision their members didn&#8217;t like, and because the House had only one hour to read the final version of the 422-page bill before floor debate and a vote was scheduled, Patrick-Lake&mdash;and the rest of us&mdash;are unable to find out what the company found out when conducting research on the implant.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDid the device alleviate migraines in test subjects? Did any test subjects report side effects? Is the device that was implanted in Patrick-Lake&#8217;s heart a boon or an extraneous foreign body? Right now, she has no way of knowing. While she considers herself cured of her migraines, further tests showed that the device (which she did receive) had not completely closed the hole in heart, leaving her vulnerable to strokes. To remove the device would require open heart surgery.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the lobbyists and members of Congress, it was business as usual in Washington. The lobbyists got a few phrases changed in a lengthy bill&mdash;phrases that would have required public access to results of clinical trials that did not lead to an approved medical device or drug. Members of the House and Senate rushed to vote on the bill with little time to note the change. For Patrick-Lake, Washington&#8217;s standard operating procedures have left her&mdash;and the public--in the dark about the device in her heart.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is true for Patrick-Lake is true for the thousands of people who volunteer for studies of drugs or medical devices every year that companies for one reason or another do not bring to market. What industry claims is proprietary information could be useful to doctors and patients as they decide what sort of treatment is best for any number of conditions. As Steven Nissen, chairman of the cardiology department at the Cleveland Clinic, says, &#8220;If you expose human beings to an experimental treatment, the public has a fundamental right to see the results of those experiments.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/projects/heart_matter/video.htm?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=310&width=390\" title=\"The Heart of the Matter\" class=\"thickbox\">Watch the video</a> and read the profiles of the players, and see what happens to an ordinary American when K Street and Congress conspire to keep Americans in the dark. And bear in mind that this struggle continues: AdvaMed and other industry interests continue to push to keep some clinical trial data secret.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3>The Patient</h3>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt wasn&#8217;t until she was six months pregnant at age 34 that Bray Patrick-Lake discovered that she was suffering from severe <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/migraine-headache/DS00120\">migraines</a>. It was Christmas time, and she was at the shopping mall with her 18-month-old son in his stroller. Suddenly, the whole right side of her body became paralyzed and she was unable to speak. That lasted about ten minutes&mdash;and then she got a really bad headache.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShe&#8217;d been sick off and on during the whole pregnancy. But she wasn&#8217;t sure what it was&mdash;pregnancy can bring on all sorts of symptoms. After the incident at the mall, however, her obstetrician sent her to a neurologist. She went through test after test, and then, finally, she got the diagnosis. And suddenly, all those headaches that she&#8217;d suffered over the previous two decades&mdash;headaches she&#8217;d written off to her sinuses or the occasional hangover&mdash;made a lot more sense.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile she was pregnant, there wasn&#8217;t much the doctors could do for her. She couldn&#8217;t go on heavy medications for fear it would harm her developing baby. After the baby arrived, she nursed her son for 13 months, so she still couldn&#8217;t go on medication because it might seep into her breast milk.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHer symptoms continued. She would slur her words, or one side of her body would get heavy. She kept getting migraines. Finally she reached the point where she was suffering from about 14 attacks a month. &#8220;A day didn&#8217;t go by where I didn&#8217;t have some kind of symptom,&#8221; she said. But Patrick-Lake, an athlete who rock climbed competitively and had lettered in four sports in school, just powered through it.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen she was finally able to start medications, she quickly discovered she couldn&#8217;t tolerate them. &#8220;They worked on my migraine, but they turned my life upside down,&#8221; she said. She&#8217;d get fits of insomnia, crying jags. She lost 20 pounds in 12 weeks. Her hair fell out. When she drove her kids to school, she&#8217;d find herself taking the wrong road. It affected her work, as director of a nonprofit serving the homeless in Longmont, Colo.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPretty soon she was seeing a full roster of medical professionals, because nobody knew quite how to classify her. She saw a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a primary care doctor.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShe got passed around. An echocardiogram showed that she had a common heart abnormality called a patent foramen ovale (PFO)&mdash;a small hole in the heart. In utero, all fetuses have this condition, which diverts blood away from undeveloped lungs, but the hole usually closes after birth. It&#8217;s estimated that as many as one in four people may have PFOs, but in most people the condition is considered to be <a href=\"http://www.aboutmigraines.com/reference/headache-news/press-releases.asp?127\">benign</a>. However, recent research that shows that <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/news/20090216/closing-a-heart-hole-may-help-migraines\">PFOs may be linked to migraines</a> for at least some people.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tExasperated, she took to the Internet and started researching. That&#8217;s how she discovered that St. Jude Medical was conducting a <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00267371?term=st+jude+escape&amp;rank=1\">clinical trial</a> for its <a href=\"http://www.sjmprofessional.com/Products/Intl/Minimally-Invasive-Structural-Heart/Premere-PFO-Closure-System.aspx\">Premere PFO closure</a> device, which was already on the market in Europe but had yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;I could have spent $10,000 and gotten one of these devices outside the country, or I could participate in a clinical trial,&#8221; said Patrick-Lake. &#8220;Part of me felt that this should be studied, that if I went through this that other people wouldn&#8217;t have to suffer.&#8221; By participating in the trial, she would also receive the device free of charge.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPatrick-Lake officially enrolled in the study on May 26, 2008. The qualification process had been extremely stringent. She had to prove that she&#8217;d failed all other treatment for migraines. She had to keep a diary of her migraines for 30 days. She had to repeat cardiac testing to show that she, indeed, suffered from a PFO.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOn June 24, 2008, she underwent a <a href=\"http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4491\">heart catheterization</a>, in which a small plastic tube was inserted into one of her arteries and was pushed up into her heart. She was participating in a &#8220;double-blind&#8221; study, designed so that neither her doctors nor she would know whether she actually received the device. She did know that two-thirds of the study participants would receive the device, one-third would not&mdash;and that she wouldn&#8217;t find out which group she was in for a full year. Getting this implant was serious business. If a patient were ever to need it removed, she would need to undergo open heart surgery.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the months that followed, Patrick-Lake did get some relief from her migraines. She also suffered some side effects. She developed an enormous bruise from the catheterization procedure, suffered from heart palpitations and chest pains, and developed drug-induced hepatitis presumably from the clot preventing drug Plavix that she was required to take. But she was still happy. &#8220;I would take chest pain and palpitations any day over my migraines,&#8221; she says.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tJust three months after Patrick-Lake had the Premere device implanted, in September 2008, St. Jude Medical announced it was canceling the trial, because, the company said, it could not recruit enough patients. (The entry on Clinicaltrials.gov, the government Web site that informs the public of ongoing research into medical devices and drugs, has <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00267371?term=st+jude+escape&amp;rank=1\">yet to be updated</a> to note this fact.)\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;I found out from the Internet,&#8221; she said, rather than through any official notification. &#8220;It sent me on such a loop&mdash;there were so many emotions. Nobody told me, and I have this device in my body for the rest of my life. It was scary because I knew it was an investigational device.&#8221; Patrick-Lake said when she followed up with her trial contacts, they said they were going to notify her at her next regular follow up appointment. She never did receive any official letter from St. Jude about the trial cancellation.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShe always strongly suspected she had the device&mdash;she says she can actually feel it in her body&mdash;but she didn&#8217;t find out officially until six months after her heart catheterization procedure, in November 2008. (She was &#8220;unblinded&#8221; after six months instead of one year because of the complications she&#8217;d been suffering.)\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile Patrick-Lake believes the Premere implant cured her migraines, she also found out that it did not close the hole in her heart completely. This means she&#8217;s still considered a high risk for strokes. And among the trial participants she found through Internet chat rooms and sites, some had problems after being implanted with the device.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tShe wonders if St. Jude knows of problems with the device that the company is not revealing. But she has no way of finding out. &#8220;I think I have the right to know that,&#8221; she says. It upset her to find that because the trial was cancelled, St. Jude Medical was not required to release trial results to her or to anybody else. &#8220;To provide for my own best care in the future, I should know everything about this device and be able to share that with my doctor.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;Science needs patients and patients need science,&#8221; says Patrick-Lake, who wants to make clear that she&#8217;s a strong proponent of clinical trials. &#8220;But patient care and safety must come first.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPatrick-Lake was shocked to find out later that in 2007, the year before she joined the trial, Congress had considered&mdash;and then, under the influence of lobbyists&mdash;rejected&mdash;a requirement that would have required companies to disclose data for products that don&#8217;t make it to market. When she found out the text of the final bill was <a href=\"http://readthebill.org/cases/drugsafety/\">available for just one hour</a> before Congress debated it, she was outraged.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;Patients didn&#8217;t have a fighting chance,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This bill was being debated and there was only one hour to respond? What could I possibly do about that? I live in Colorado. It&#8217;s stunning that this could happen.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNow Patrick-Lake has become an advocate for patient rights. She flew on her own dime in June 2009 to testify before the FDA&#8217;s committee on transparency, urging agency officials to do a better job of treating patients and that the FDA be more transparent. She has also joined the circulatory system devices panel of the medical devices advisory committee as a patient representative.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA spokesperson for St. Jude Medical would not comment on the situation, stating that &#8220;Because patients are still in the follow up period of the study, it is premature to comment to publications at this time.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>The Company</h3>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn March 2006, St. Jude Medical Inc., a publicly traded company that makes implants to treat cardiac and neurological disorders, <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73836&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=825292&highlight=\">began testing</a> a device it hoped would bolster the company&#8217;s bottom line in years to come and enrolled their first participant for the trial.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe device in question, the Premere PFO was designed to treat a common heart defect, called <a href=\"https://www.google.com/health/ref/Patent+foramen+ovale\">patent foramen ovale</a>. Another company, Velocimed LLC, actually developed the Premere implant; St. Jude Medical <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73836&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=675070&highlight=\">acquired</a> that firm in February 2005 for $82.5 million.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThough the <a href=\"http://www.premereformfunction.com/\">Premere</a> still needed the approval of the Food and Drug Administration before it could be sold in the United States when St. Jude Medical acquired Velocimed, the company believed that the device would be a money maker. In Sept. 2005, John Heinmiller, the company&#8217;s CFO and treasurer, told potential investors at a health care conference hosted by Bear Stearns that the implant was an important part of its long-term strategy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe prospects for Premere looked good. The previous May, the company <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73836&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=712582&highlight=\">launched</a> it and two other new cardiology devices in Europe. And in August, about a month before Heinmiller&#8217;s remarks, the FDA approved St. Jude Medical&#8217;s request to begin enrolling patients in its <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73836&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=749075&highlight=\">ESCAPE trial</a> for suffers of extreme migraines, which would determine whether the device could help sufferers of migraine headaches.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe company initially announced that the ESCAPE trial would be complete by 2007. However, in September 2008, St. Jude Medical stopped enrollment in the ESCAPE study, a company representative said, after concluding that it would not recruit enough participants to complete the trial until 2016.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe following month, in October 2008, chief executive officer Dan Starks told investors that the ESCAPE migraine trial was closed because of difficulty in enrolling enough patients&mdash;only 50 had signed up. While &#8220;the space&#8221; of exploring PFO closure for migraine treatment &#8220;remains of interest,&#8221; he said, the regulatory requirements for enrolling patients in the study proved too great. Apparently the company found it difficult to recruit patients under the stringent study design, which required patients to undergo extensive testing and agree to a trial where they had a two-out-of-three chance of receiving the device.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;It&#8217;s not something that we&#8217;ve referred to for some time as one of our growth drivers and it would be appropriate to take it off the list of our growth drivers that we're particularly excited about,&#8221; he told investors on a third quarter earnings conference call in 2008.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA company representative later stated that the company has no intention of re-opening the study. Meanwhile, the information collected in that study from participants such as Bray Patrick-Lake remain the property of the company.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough the Premere device never won FDA approval for treatment of migraines, St. Jude Medical continues to sell and profit from the device in Europe. The company&#8217;s Web site advertises the implant&#8217;s virtues on a Web site that cautions its information is &#8220;not intended for users in the United States or those affiliated with U.S. institutions, as this website contains information about product and therapies that are not available or authorized for use in U.S.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>The Lobbyists</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn 2007, when Congress was debating legislation on transparency in clinical trials, the pharmaceutical and medical device industries were well positioned to make their voices heard.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, employees, their family members and PACs of firms in the industry contributed $3.4 million to members of the House Energy and Commerce and the Senate Health Education and Labor Committees. Those two committees had primary responsibility for drafting and debating the reauthorization bill that sought to bring greater transparency to clinical trial data, called the Medical Device User Fee Amendments Act.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe drug and device manufacturers also had a few hundred lobbyists in their employ. The three main trade associations for these interests&mdash;the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of America, the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), and the Medical Device Manufacturers Association&mdash;had by themselves hired nearly 200 lobbyists.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A provision in the House version of the bill that would have made results from terminated clinical trials public was eliminated. But sadly, there is no federal lobbying disclosure that reveals whether a particular lobbyist or group of lobbyists had an impact on the language on clinical trial data that ended up in the final bill. According to sources who helped draft the House version of the bill, key negotiators agreed to drop the provision concerning the unapproved device's data.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo disclosure tells us whether lobbyists for AdvaMed, PhRMA or the Medical Device Manufacturers Association contacted members of the conference committee who settled on the bills final language.

Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., introduced <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1082/show\">S. 1082</a>, the Medical Device User Fee Amendments Act, directed toward a prosaic end: the bill would reauthorize fees that drug and medical device manufacturers pay that fund the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s work. Without the reauthorization, the fees would expire, and Congress would have to find some other source of funding for the FDA.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReauthorizations are typically not controversial measures, but by 2007, growing public and congressional concern stemming from a series of high profile drugs that proved dangerous despite winning FDA approval made the reauthorization bill the subject of greater scrutiny. Vioxx, developed by Merck as the next new wonder pain relief drug, was found to increase the incidence of heart attacks among users and removed from the market in 2004. That same year, the first of several studies found a link between youth suicides and common antidepressants like Paxil, made by GlaxoSmithKline, and Zoloft, sold by Pfizer.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn 2004, <a href=\"http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/hearing111804.htm\">Congress held hearings</a> on these approved drugs that had deadly consequences, excoriating the companies involved and the FDA for ignoring the danger signals revealed from clinical trials and other evidence. And in 2006, the General Accounting Office, Congress&#8217; investigative arm, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06402.pdf\">published a report</a> highlighting systemic problems in the FDA&#8217;s ability to respond to dangers caused by approved drugs.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reauthorization legislation in 2007 became a vehicle for addressing some of these wrongs. Among the remedies proposed was more transparency, which Kennedy highlighted on the Senate floor:\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;In many cases, companies have hidden evidence of safety problems. Our bill addresses this abuse by including a public database of all clinical trials and their results. Listen to that: all clinical trials and their results. We protect the trademark aspects of the particular item but require the publication of all clinical trials and their results. A company will no longer be able to hide the results if they do not show what the company wanted.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA government Web site called <a href=\"http://ClinicalTrials.gov\">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> had been posting ongoing clinical trials by companies seeking FDA approval for drugs or medical devices meant to treat &#8220;serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions&#8221; since 1997.  However, that site only provided lists of <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126838.pdf\">ongoing trials</a>.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1082/show\">Senate legislation</a> required that companies report the results of their clinical trials when they were finished, provided that the drugs or devices received FDA approval.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the House, however, lawmakers took a different approach to the clinical trials database. Like its Senate counterpart, the House version of the bill, <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h2900/show\">H.R. 2900</a>, included language that made more information available on clinical trials, including the publication of results from these trials. But the House bill specifically stated that the results must be made available to the public whether or not the drug or device being tested had been approved by the FDA.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tConsumer advocates argued that it was important to inform patients of results of trials even for products that are not approved. &#8220;If you expose human beings to an experimental treatment, the public has a fundamental right to see the results of those experiments,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the cardiology department at the Cleveland Clinic, who helped develop the House proposal.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMedical device and drug manufacturers far preferred the Senate version, arguing that publishing information about products that had not received approval could hurt their bottom line. &#8220;The current language\u2026would harm device innovation without any benefit to patients,&#8221; testified Stephen J. Ubl, president and CEO of the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), &#8220;When there is no FDA-approved product, information related to the device design and to the design of the trial and its endpoints is the only intellectual property a company may have. Such disclosures could have the unintended consequence of eliminating many small device companies from the marketplace.\" [<a href=\"http://www.advamed.org/NR/rdonlyres/3971013A-3775-44ED-8685-5644D0C24B98/0/mdufmatestimony61207.pdf\">PDF</a>]\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOn May 9, the Senate passed its version of the legislation, S. 1082, by a vote of 93 to 1. On July 11, the House passed its version of the bill&mdash;including the broader transparency requirement&mdash;by a vote of 403 to 16. Then the bill sat. And sat. Meanwhile, lobbyists for interests opposed to the transparency provision, including a trade group that included St. Jude Medical Inc. among its members, pushed their point of view. [See &#8220;<a href=\"#lobbyists\">The Lobbyists</a>&#8221;]\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe bill sat in limbo until September, when Congress faced a crucial deadline. The user fee provisions in the law were about to run out, and unless Congress reauthorized them&mdash;that is, passed the new version of the bill&mdash;by the end of the month, the FDA couldn&#8217;t collect from drug and device makers the funding it needed to continue its safety reviews of drugs and medical devices.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOn September 19, a new version of <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h3580/show\">the bill</a> emerged, some 422 pages long. The bill was available for just <a href=\"http://readthebill.org/cases/drugsafety/\">one hour</a> before House members began debate. The House voted 405 to 7 to approve it, and the Senate followed suit the next day, passing it by unanimous consent.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe House language, which would have required that results data for unapproved products be made available, was gone. The new language looked a lot more like the Senate version&mdash;except now there was explicit language about &#8220;unapproved products.&#8221; According to the bill, it would be up to federal agencies to determine through regulations whether any data would be made available for products that are not approved by the FDA.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to sources who helped draft the House version of the bill, key negotiators agreed to drop the provision concerning the unapproved devices data. When the final language went to the full House, there was only an hour to review it before the debate; no member objected to the change.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the question of who should have access to data collected from patients participating in terminated clinical trials is still being raised.

At such a vulnerable moment, they may not always check all the fine print when they sign the papers to join a study, and often are not aware of all the ramifications involved in the byzantine agency drug and medical device approval process.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile researchers are supposed to notify patients if there are any dangers that emerge in studying a device or drug, and are obliged to follow patients who participate all the way through a trial, companies do not always live up to this.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor example, in 2007, the FDA sent a warning to Boston Scientific after investigators discovered that the company stopped following up with patients implanted with an experimental stent meant to prevent rupturing in aneurysms. The company, which stopped studying the product after finding out it frequently fractured, did not tell patients about the full scope of the problem, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/business/30device.html?pagewanted=all\">New York Times reported</a>. For patients who participate in medical device trials, lacking this information is particularly disturbing&mdash;after all, they have these devices implanted in their bodies indefinitely.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe agency suffers from severe shortcomings in following up on medical devices after they reach the market place, according to June 2009 testimony by <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09370t.pdf\">Marcia Crosse</a> of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) before a Congressional committee. While the number of &#8220;adverse events&#8221; associated with medical devices has increased substantially in recent years, the FDA lacks the resources to review all the submitted reports in a timely manner, &#8220; she said. &#8220;FDA officials told us that while they have a number of strategies to prioritize their reviews of adverse event reports, they still cannot review all the reports they receive.&#8221;\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOften clinical data collected for devices or drugs that don&#8217;t make to the market could provide crucial information&mdash;however, this information is not made generally available to the public.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor example, ciglatazone, a drug that was the first in a particular class of drugs developed to treat diabetes, was shown to cause liver damage in clinical trials, and never reached the market. Another drug from the same class, troglitazone, received approval. Later it was also found to cause liver damage. The data from these trials was not made public.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;Knowing the adverse event profile of ciglitazone and others in the class, might have cued clinicians and drug safety experts to look earlier and more closely for these adverse events,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#documentDetail?R=0900006480a063dd\">wrote Allan Coukell</a> a pharmacist and director of the Pew Prescription Project, in recent comments to the NIH.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is no requirement that a company or the FDA release information about clinical trials if the drug or medical device in question is not approved for the market place. <a href=\"#congress\">Congress</a> considered such a requirement in 2007, when passing a law reauthorizing industry user fees that help fund the agency&#8217;s work, but dropped it under heavy lobbying by the drug and medical device industries.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMedical device process\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow risky is the medical device?
