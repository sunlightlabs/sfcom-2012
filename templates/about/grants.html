<h2>Who We Fund</h2>
<p>The Sunlight Foundation offers “transparency grants” for organizations that are using the Web to further our mission of making government information more accessible to the American people. Our goal is to support groups and individuals who are going beyond the traditional, single subject public disclosure database, and who are interested in creating cutting-edge tools to enable the media, bloggers and citizens to sift, share and combine government data in ways that are useful for them.</p>
<p>To apply for a transparency grant from the Sunlight Foundation, <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> for guidelines. To apply for a mini-grant ($1,000-$5,000), submit a <a href="/grants/application/">grant application</a>.</p>
<p>To date, Sunlight's major transparency grants have included:</p>
