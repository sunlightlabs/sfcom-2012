	<h2>Policy Successes</h2>
	<p>Sunlight's work with government leads to real changes in how we access public information.  Below are some of the reforms we have championed.</p>

	<ul class="sectionspace docs" id="document_link">
	<li><h4><a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/11/01/72-hours-is-now/">House Commitment to 72 Hour Posting of Legislation</a></h4>
	<p>Speaker Pelosi took an important step toward disclosure in posting both the finalized <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=health+care+72+hours&aq=f&aqi=g1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=">health care</a> bill and <a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/06/25/financial-reform-read-the-bill/">financial regulatory reform</a> legislation online for 72 hours prior to House votes.  While there is now a higher public expectation of congressional leadership to post all non-emergency bills online for a 3-day period and many legislators are voluntarily committing to doing so, Sunlight encourages passage of <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr554/show">H.Res.554</a> to cement this rule in law.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li><h4><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/projects/expenditures/">House and Senate Disbursements Required to be Posted Online</a></h4>
	<p>
	Five months after Speaker Pelosi's announcement of a new disclosure policy, the House <a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/11/30/house-expenditures-to-go-online/">released</a> its quarterly Statement of Disbursements online for the first time in November of 2009 and has continued to release them on a quarterly basis.  The Senate recently <a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/07/07/success-senate-to-post-expenditure-reports/">followed suit</a>, adopting an amendment offered by Senator Tom Coburn to the Fiscal Year 2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act that will require all disbursement reports to be posted online beginning in 2011. Sunlight <a href="http://publicmarkup.org/bill/transparency-government-act-2008-revised/1/107/">first proposed</a> posting congressional disbursements online in its 2008 working draft of the Transparency in Government Act.

	<h4><a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/03/25/reps-quigley-issa-and-17-others-form-congressional-transparency-caucus/">House Members form Congressional Transparency Caucus</a></h4>
	<p>
	In March of 2010, Representatives Mike Quigley and Darrell Issa joined together to create the Congressional Transparency Caucus, a bipartisan group of lawmakers committed to bringing transparency and accountability issues to the legislative forefront. The caucus boasts more than 30 members and continues to grow.  To support the goals of the caucus, Sunlight created an <a href="http://transparencycaucus.org/">Advisory Committee on Transparency</a> tasked with educating Members and their staff on transparency-related issues, problems, and solutions.
	</p>

	<li>
	<h4><a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/04/21/financial-reform-bill-has-a-small-transparency-win/">Transparency Provision Included in Final Financial Regulation Bill</a></h4>
	<p>
	Sunlight-endorsed language was included in the conference report of the <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/show/">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> that requires the disclosure of the names of all non-government members serving on any advisory, technical, or professional committee supporting the Financial Services Oversight Council.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<h4><a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/05/20/electronic-filing-provision-included-in-disclose-act-a-win-for-transparency/">Transparency Amendment Included in the DISCLOSE Act</a></h4>
	<p>
	A Sunlight-supported amendment was successfully included in the House-passed version of the <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h5175/show">DISCLOSE Act</a> (and in the still-pending Senate version of the bill, too).  The amendment, sponsored by Representative Susan Davis, requires new disclosures to be filed electronically with the Federal Election Commission, and requires bulk access to those filings.

	<h4><a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/07/28/baby-steps-on-the-earmark-transparency-act/">Earmark Transparency Act Reported Out of Senate Committee</a></h4>
	<p>
	On July 28, 2010, the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee held its second debate on Senator Tom Coburn's bill, <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s3335/show">S.3335</a>, and reported the bill out of committee by a vote of 11 to 5. The bill requires Congress to establish and maintain a centralized, publicly accessible website containing all requested earmarks, a change that Sunlight has advocated. A <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h5258/show">companion bill</a> was also simultaneously introduced in the House this May by Representatives Bill Cassidy and Jackie Speier. Sunlight provided input on the bill, largely based on the Reporting Group's <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/topics/earmarks/">experience</a> of using earmark disclosures in its work.
	</p>

	<h4><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/poia/">Public Online Information Act Introduced</a></h4>
	<p>
	Introduced by Representative Steve Israel in the House and Senator Jon Tester in the Senate, the Public Online Information Act (POIA) requires executive branch agencies to publish all publicly available information on the Internet in a timely fashion and in user-friendly formats. It also creates an independent, bipartisan advisory committee to help develop government-wide Internet publication policies. POIA grew from Sunlight's reform agenda, and also from Senior Technology Consultant Andrew Rasiej's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uEQL93MJAQ#t=22m48s">panel</a> at the Personal Democracy Forum in 2009.

	<h4><a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/03/25/rep-quigley-introduces-the-transparency-in-government-act-you-helped-make-it-happen/">Transparency in Government Act Introduced</a></h4>
	<p>
	Sunlight has long supported the passage of an omnibus transparency bill. The Transparency in Government Act, sponsored by Representative Mike Quigley, updates current congressional disclosure requirements to make more information about lawmakers and lobbyists, congressional staff, and the executive branch meaningfully accessible to the public, with an emphasis on digitizing and publishing congressional information online. This bill builds on the Transparency in Government Act created by the Sunlight Foundation in 2008, and refined through the site <a href="http://www.publicmarkup.org/">PublicMarkup.org</a>, where comments and responses were added directly to the bill.

	<h4><a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/10/03/web-use-reform-happy-ending/">House and Senate Franking Rules Changed</a></h4>
	<p>
	In 2007, the Open House Project proposed the loosening of rules governing what lawmakers can post to their official web sites. In September of 2008, the Senate Committe on Rules and Administration <a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/09/24/senate-changes-franking-rules-for-web-sites/#comments">approved new rules</a> to allow lawmakers to post content from third party sites such as YouTube, Flickr, Twitter, and others. The House <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/blog/?p=1534">followed suit</a> a month later, joining the Senate in updating the arcane guidelines that govern how Members of Congress use the Internet.

	<h4><a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2009/victory-fec-launches-data-catalog/">FEC Launches Data Catalog</a></h4>
	<p>
	&#8220;On top of that, they're beginning to make data available in standard, extensible, machine readable formats. They're moving beyond COBOL (which
	apparently is celebrating its <a href="http://www.cobolanniversary.com/index.htm">50th anniversary</a>!) towards CSV, XML and RSS, alongside PDF and fairly solid HTML <a href="http://www.fec.gov/data/Leadership.do?format=html">interface</a>

	<h4><a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/10/05/federal-register-xml-release/">Federal Register Released in XML</a></h4>
	<p>
	&#8220;The Government Printing Office will today release, for the first time, the
	XML version of the <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/">Federal Register</a> available to the public, online, featuring the Federal Register back to the
	year 2000.&#8221;

	<h4><a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2007/01/11/senate-agrees-to-amendment-on-committee/">Senate Requires Committee Transcripts Online in S1</a></h4>
	<p>
	&#8220;According to one estimate, a transcript or electronic recording is available online for only about one-half of all Senate committee and subcommittee
	hearings. Only for one-half of those hearings is there made available a transcript that the public can actually access. That number is far too low. There is no reason why, in this day of modern technology and communications, we should not be able to achieve a goal of 100 percent.&#8221;

	<p>&#8220;Two recommendations of the <a href="http://www.theopenhouseproject.com/">Open House Project</a> report have been taken up in the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1105">FY09 omnibus appropriations bill</a> (H.R. 1105).&#8221;
