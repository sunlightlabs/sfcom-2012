Disclaimer: I am an Apture Co-founder, but the reason we're building these tools is so you can link to those specific moments of C-SPAN speeches, the specific buried page of a document, or someone's recorded meeting with someone else.  I think these tools could offer a totally new level of transparency in government which would be really exciting.

18,"Public Participation Principles","When engaging in public participation efforts, government should adhere to the seven Core Values for the Practice of Public Participation as outlined by the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2):

1. Public participation is based on the belief that those who are affected by a decision have a right to be involved in the decision-making process.

2. Public participation includes the promise that the public's contribution will influence the decision.

3. Public participation promotes sustainable decisions by recognizing and communicating the needs and interests of all participants, including decision makers.

4. Public participation seeks out and facilitates the involvement of those potentially affected by or interested in a decision.

5. Public participation seeks input from participants in designing how they participate.

6. Public participation provides participants with the information they need to participate in a meaningful way.

7. Public participation communicates to participants how their input affected the decision.

14,"Provide Internet Access with Unemployment Benefits","How is this recovery going to be different from 1930's?

Unemployment benefits should be bundled with Internet access.  It is part of the investment in the transitioning worker. It is a critical part of the modern ""safety net"". It will create jobs.

Why should we do this?

    * People need to job hunt.
    * the unemployed need to interact with government agencies and services and online access would reduce government servicing costs.
    * It would help nonprofits and food banks squeeze more efficiency in the way the coordinate delivery of services and assessing needs. 
    * It would create an intensive online training program (from basic computer skills (how to email, network and search) to all the free and more advanced training online.
    * employees could stay in touch with previous coworkers (DHL alumni group on Linked-in) and family at reduced costs.
    * it would up our workforces competitiveness and prepare the unemployed to collaborate on projects for new jobs.
    * the new free web services (gmail,google docs, skype, etc.) enable productivity in the cloud. so event thee $39 computer or the web books would meet basic needs.
    * it would open up lots of new self-organizing (laidoffcamp.org) and new business start up. 
    * It is important for the families that are trying to figure out housing availability, stay connected with schools and teachers.
    * the unemployed on the program (using the govt access pages) could be asked to review elements of the recovery activity, congressional budgets, state budgets, etc.(would probably find enough mistakes to pay for the whole program)
    * when companies want to rehire or pull from their former workforce they could easily reactivate the latent parts of our workforce.
    * Emotional support, entertainment, etc.
    * They could cut off other services (like cable and phone) to save money.
    * It would generate a new revenue and industry from states for web businesses that could target reengaging the unemployed. 
    * If it shortens unemployment of each persons by just a few weeks it would pay for itself. (480 per person per year).
    * It would accelerate the use of the stimulus dollars, tax programs, etc.
    * It would shorten the amount of time it takes to find the unemployed and fill new positions (saving business money)
    * It would keep the unemployed a more powerful political force.
    * It is a manageable cost program. (worst case = 40 a month * 4 million unemployed * 12 = 2 billion ).   The faster the unemployed find work and get into positions where they create value others are willing to purchase the faster the economy recovers.

72,"Amend the National Bank Act to Prevent Housing Bubbles","Congress should amend the National Bank Act to mandate that all FDIC insured institutions must average at least two of three separate residential appraisal methods in determining a homes value, if a home will serve as security for a bank loan.  

The widespread use of the Comparative Sales Method as a sole source for appraising the value of mortgage security (the home) causes values to detach from economic reality under conditions of very lax credit, as we have seen in recent years.  

This is an easy step to housing bubbles from happening again in the future.

24,"Wiki-review of Obama's ""Open Govt. Directive""","Use a ""wiki"" to allow the public to participate in developing the ""Open Government Directive"" (OGoD) in a transparent, partipatory, and collaborative way. 

Wikipedia is the best-known example of how, properly done, the ""wisdom of the crowd"" can now produce a better picture of reality than just the small group of experts alone.

Some federal agencies are already using internal wikis to gather and distill their employees' collective intelligence on various policies, programs and projects within the agency. http://fcw.com/Articles/2009/01/26/Who-is-using-wikis.aspx

And so, it should come as no surprise when the increased use of wikis is one of the recommendations in the OGoD report to the White House (due on or before May 21).

So, if the OGoD report does suggest some trials of using wikis to allow the public's collective wisdom to come forth on development of policy and procedures, then it would stand to reason that the most obvious candidate for the first experiment would be the OGoD report itself.

Otherwise, it will be just another ""top-down"" report with the unwritten message of ""Do as I say, not as I do.""  And, given the subject (public engagement), that would be the height of hypocrisy.

P.S. As a former fed, I still like to craft acronyms. And knowing the reaction that many politicians and bureaucrats have to open-government policy, then ""OGoD"" seems very appropriate.

Users can then see if 80% of their news and information is coming from the same parent company, what percentage of their information comes from big media companies and how much is smaller-scale or independent journalism/media.

Using existing data from broadcasters, users can select the programs they watch (NBC Nightly News, NPR Fresh Air, Bill O'Reilly, Democracy Now, Daily Show) and read (Drudge Report, The Daily Beast, Financial Times, Washington Post), and be provided with a visual pie chart and graphs display illustrating the ownership and diversity of their information sources.

-------

This would be a pretty simple idea to execute, and might be done by simply working with Columbia to expand its current project. It would be ideal to host it on an expanded Fed, State and Local OpenCongress-style Sunlight page, where users can come to learn about and influence their government, as well as themselves and the habits that shape their outlook.

78,"Citizens' Elections Security Tracking Tool & Restoration Forum","Several websites and organizations compile information about the security (or lack there of) of Fed, state, & local elections laws & protocols. Chain of custody, ballot access, voter registration security. This info is spread out, and often so specific that it is only accessed, read, and discussed by elections officials and elections security 'nerds.' The constituents most in need of secure elections, and most capable of forcing their representatives to amend current practices, are left without a large and decipherable body knowledge, as well as user-friendly tools to advance the cause.
<br>
Rather than attempt to legislate costly top-down change, as even VP Biden has advocated against, create some type of framework into which volunteers (or elections officials) can dump/fill in data that visually illustrates the ballot chain of custody -- from Constitutional guarantee of their right to vote, to ballot printing, to vote counting procedure and machine software security, to final storage and eventual disposal.
<br>
I imagine a time line-like interactive chain of custody illustration, where users can consult elections law to fill out the chain, and discussion forum threads accompany each step. Users can discuss/debate the best options and rate the vulnerability of their vote at that moment on a color-grade scale (yellow to red, to illustrate areas of greatest need and concern.) Threads will be cross-referenced to similar topics/issues in other localities, so that Palm Beach County users can investigate ad discuss the cheapest and most secure adhesive non-removable ballot seals, with Orange County users faced with the same problem.
<br>
The tool can become a great classroom civics project for students, where the class will dedicate itself to learning the necessity and means of maintaining secure elections, while getting hands-on experience working with their local government as pro-active citizen activists (even if it does entail something as simple as researching adhesive stickers.) Students will learn to investigate a problem, find a solution, and how to present ti to an elected official so that its value is undeniable, and their efforts deliver real world results.
<br>
If and when OpenCongress evolves into a civics tool that includes state & local government, this will be as a great addition. The strength of it, is that once the ""formula""/coding has been written out, users will drive the entire process.

68,"I am so angry...","...at the way money is being spent, but not being used as it was intended to!  So much so, that I put up a billboard at 31st and Chestnut St. in Philaselphia to express my outrage.  I've laid out a simple plan (www.PlanForUS.com), but how do I get someone to run the numbers and comment on it?

Everyone is angry that bank CEOs got billions in bonuses, while we are getting laid off. Why has no one seriously considered any bailout plan that begins with taxpayers first?  I can no longer watch in horrific fascination while being told that there is only one, same-old way to skin a cat, while we are all getting skinned.  

President Obama openly stated that he will listen to any plan, so I want him to hear mine -- the Plan For US.  It is an astonishingly simple plan that not only addresses his concerns, but is designed to instantly make funds available for banks to lend out and stir up business, and, instead of a tax cut, provides real money for each taxpayer. 

The Plan For US focuses on who the money is ultimately meant to trickle down to, the American worker.  Any successful stimulus package will surpass one trillion dollars (mark my words).  Presuming there are 140,000,000 taxpayers in the United States, each taxpayer is earmarked $7,500 for a total cost of 1.05 trillion dollars.

$2,500 will be withheld by the IRS.  Instantly, $350 billion will be available for education, rebuilding infrastructure, alternative energy, human services, and extending unemployment benefits.

$2,500 will be held for the taxpayer in a bank account, not to be withdrawn for three years.  Instantly, $350 billion will be infused in American financial institutions, interest-free for three years.  This money will be made available to provide low-cost mortgages and loans to businesses.  The Secretary of the Treasury will be made accountable to oversee the banks do what they are supposed to do, making sure the taxpayers get their money back with interest.

$2,500 will go directly to the taxpayer.  Not only will $350 billion in the hands of taxpayers help jump-start the economy,but it will help rebuild consumer confidence.  People will know where their money is and what it is doing.  And it will teach our children sound financial strategy.  You pay your taxes.  You save.  You spend. 

People feel beaten down.  The stock market is down.  Confidence is down. Everyone needs to speak out and tell our elected officials we need a plan that not only provides immediate relief to our government, banks, and taxpayers, but also helps rebuild our collective psychological backbone.
