<h3>Why Oppose Roberts Amendment?</h3>
<p>At this moment, Sen. Roberts, who insists on adding an unnecessary, poison pill amendment, is blocking the bill. </p><p>The amendment proposed by Sen. Roberts would reduce accountability by requiring outside groups filing ethics complaints to reveal their sources of funding. This provision would constitute an unconstitutional burden on charities, religious bodies and non-profits attempting to ensure the operation of an honest and clean government.

    <h4>Suggested Conversation Script</h4>
    <p>I am calling to ask Senator Martinez to support S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act.
    This simple bill will ensure that senators file their campaign finance disclosure reports electronically, just like House members and Presidential candidates.</p>

    <p>Will Senator Martinez cosponsor or vote in favor of S. 482?</p>

                <p>I am calling to ask Senator Martinez to oppose the Roberts Amendment to S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act. S. 482 is about transparency. The Roberts amendment would mean a <i>less</i> transparent Senate because it would result in fewer ethics complaints being filed by nonprofit organizations.</p>

    <p>Can you tell me if he plans to oppose it? </p>

    S. 482 is common sense, uncontroversial legislation that will pass as long as the Roberts Amendment fails.</p>

If we can not vote against every Senator or Representative that has served a second term in office we will never get rid of corruption.  Money breeds power and power breeds corruption.  Limit terms of Senators and Representatives.  Of course representative terms will have to be extended in length to match the senators.  All to four years as the president.  
All campaign funds of equal amounts given to the qualified for candidates.  Democrat, Republican and Independent.  Equal TV time.  No other money involved.  Democravy for Capitalism. </td>

  <td width="40%">I have called and e-mailed both Florida senators Martinez and Nelson, these two are about are some of the most worthless pieces of humanity that breath neither will commit to support or co-sponsor S. 482.  We need to clean house.  Every elected federal official needs to be term limited to no more than 2 terms in office or a total of 8 years.  Federal Court judges including the Supreme Court needs to be limited to no more than 10 years.   Ff these people are not smart enough to steal their ill gotten fortunes in either an 8 or 10 year term then they are too stupid to be in office.  

&quot;A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague.&quot;
