<h3>Why Oppose Roberts Amendment?</h3>
<p>At this moment, Sen. Roberts, who insists on adding an unnecessary, poison pill amendment, is blocking the bill. </p><p>The amendment proposed by Sen. Roberts would reduce accountability by requiring outside groups filing ethics complaints to reveal their sources of funding. This provision would constitute an unconstitutional burden on charities, religious bodies and non-profits attempting to ensure the operation of an honest and clean government.

    <h4>Suggested Conversation Script</h4>
    <p>I am calling to ask Senator Burris to support S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act.
    This simple bill will ensure that senators file their campaign finance disclosure reports electronically, just like House members and Presidential candidates.</p>

    <p>Will Senator Burris cosponsor or vote in favor of S. 482?</p>

                <p>I am calling to ask Senator Burris to oppose the Roberts Amendment to S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act. S. 482 is about transparency. The Roberts amendment would mean a <i>less</i> transparent Senate because it would result in fewer ethics complaints being filed by nonprofit organizations.</p>

    <p>Can you tell me if he plans to oppose it? </p>

    <p>Please let Senator Burris know that the Roberts Amendment undermines the privacy and First Amendment rights of donors to nonprofits. Many organizations will decide against filing ethics complaints in order to protect those rights.

    </div>

    <div class="script_item oppose_amendment_answer" id="oppose_amendment_no">

    <p>Please let Senator Burris know that I hope he reconsiders. Voting in favor of the Roberts amendment will hurt S. 482's chances of becoming law.
    S. 482 is common sense, uncontroversial legislation that will pass as long as the Roberts Amendment fails.</p>

Change On Illinois before we all find ourselves not only in tough times but an economic dust bowl the likes of the 1930&#39;s from over corrupt campaign finance cultivation and lack of politician crop rotation.
