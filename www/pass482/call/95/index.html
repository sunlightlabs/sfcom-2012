<h3>Why Oppose Roberts Amendment?</h3>
<p>At this moment, Sen. Roberts, who insists on adding an unnecessary, poison pill amendment, is blocking the bill. </p><p>The amendment proposed by Sen. Roberts would reduce accountability by requiring outside groups filing ethics complaints to reveal their sources of funding. This provision would constitute an unconstitutional burden on charities, religious bodies and non-profits attempting to ensure the operation of an honest and clean government.

    <h4>Suggested Conversation Script</h4>
    <p>I am calling to ask Senator Warner to support S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act.
    This simple bill will ensure that senators file their campaign finance disclosure reports electronically, just like House members and Presidential candidates.</p>

    <p>Will Senator Warner cosponsor or vote in favor of S. 482?</p>

                <p>I am calling to ask Senator Warner to oppose the Roberts Amendment to S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act. S. 482 is about transparency. The Roberts amendment would mean a <i>less</i> transparent Senate because it would result in fewer ethics complaints being filed by nonprofit organizations.</p>

    <p>Can you tell me if he plans to oppose it? </p>

    <p>Please let Senator Warner know that the Roberts Amendment undermines the privacy and First Amendment rights of donors to nonprofits. Many organizations will decide against filing ethics complaints in order to protect those rights.

    </div>

    <div class="script_item oppose_amendment_answer" id="oppose_amendment_no">

    <p>Please let Senator Warner know that I hope he reconsiders. Voting in favor of the Roberts amendment will hurt S. 482's chances of becoming law.
    S. 482 is common sense, uncontroversial legislation that will pass as long as the Roberts Amendment fails.</p>

  <td width="40%">The receptionist said she was not authorized to comment on legislation that the Senator has yet to vote on.

This is just speculation, but I thought it sounded like she was echoing a broader office policy, rather than a rule for her and lower staff alone -- was left with this feeling because she didn&#39;t offer to refer me to a qualified staffer or spokesperson. I didn&#39;t even specify what legislation I was curious about.

When you call, ask to be directed to someone who can comment. If you hit a wall, ask what their policy is on commenting about pending legislation.</td>

  <td width="40%">1) My call was made at 1030 2009.04.03. I spoke with a male, who did not identify himself.

2) I asked him if he could speak to Senator Warner&#39;s position on S. 482, he said &#39;can you hang on a moment?&#39; and put me on hold for less than 1 minute. On returning to the phone, he asked me for my full name, mailing address and a contact email. I provided them.

3) I again asked to speak to someone who could provide me with the Senator&#39;s Official response as to his stance on S. 482. 

4) The gentleman put me on hold for approximately two minutes. On his return to the phone, he informed me that the person that could provide me with the Senator&#39;s position on this Bill was named Michelle, and currently out of the office. I could leave her a voice mail message for her at her extension, or he could take down the information I would like the Senator&#39;s response to and pass it to her.

5) I mentioned that I had been following Senator Warner&#39;s record over the past years (I have) and that since I rarely disagreed with his positions (also true) I was curious as to why he did not support S. 482, or if in fact was the information I found on the Internet regarding his lack of support for this bill true or not? I told the gentleman that I would appreciate it if he could ensure Michelle received my request and forwarded the response to either my mailing address or email address, previously given to him. He said thank you,  and hung up.

I will keep up with this... stay tuned
