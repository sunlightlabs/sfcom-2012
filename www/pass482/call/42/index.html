<h3>Why Oppose Roberts Amendment?</h3>
<p>At this moment, Sen. Roberts, who insists on adding an unnecessary, poison pill amendment, is blocking the bill. </p><p>The amendment proposed by Sen. Roberts would reduce accountability by requiring outside groups filing ethics complaints to reveal their sources of funding. This provision would constitute an unconstitutional burden on charities, religious bodies and non-profits attempting to ensure the operation of an honest and clean government.

    <h4>Suggested Conversation Script</h4>
    <p>I am calling to ask Senator Hagan to support S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act.
    This simple bill will ensure that senators file their campaign finance disclosure reports electronically, just like House members and Presidential candidates.</p>

    <p>Will Senator Hagan cosponsor or vote in favor of S. 482?</p>

                <p>I am calling to ask Senator Hagan to oppose the Roberts Amendment to S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act. S. 482 is about transparency. The Roberts amendment would mean a <i>less</i> transparent Senate because it would result in fewer ethics complaints being filed by nonprofit organizations.</p>

    <p>Can you tell me if she plans to oppose it? </p>

    <h5 class="orange">If "I Don't Know" or "Senator Hasn't Decided Yet" on opposing Roberts amendment </h5>
    <p>Please let Senator Hagan know that the Roberts Amendment undermines the privacy and First Amendment rights of donors to nonprofits. Many organizations will decide against filing ethics complaints in order to protect those rights. 
    <h5 class="end_call">The call is now complete. Please record your findings below.</h5>

    </div>

    <div class="script_item oppose_amendment_answer" id="oppose_amendment_no">
    <h5 class="red">If "No" on opposing Roberts amendment </h5>
    <p>Please let Senator Hagan know that I hope she reconsiders. Voting in favor of the Roberts amendment will hurt S. 482's chances of becoming law.
    S. 482 is common sense, uncontroversial legislation that will pass as long as the Roberts Amendment fails.</p>

My associates and I will be following this closely. We ask you NOT to support Roberts ammendment. Thank you for your service.&quot;
