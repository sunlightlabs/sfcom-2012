<h3>Why Oppose Roberts Amendment?</h3>
<p>At this moment, Sen. Roberts, who insists on adding an unnecessary, poison pill amendment, is blocking the bill. </p><p>The amendment proposed by Sen. Roberts would reduce accountability by requiring outside groups filing ethics complaints to reveal their sources of funding. This provision would constitute an unconstitutional burden on charities, religious bodies and non-profits attempting to ensure the operation of an honest and clean government.

    <p>I am calling to ask Senator Udall to support S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act.
    This simple bill will ensure that senators file their campaign finance disclosure reports electronically, just like House members and Presidential candidates.</p>

    <p>Will Senator Udall cosponsor or vote in favor of S. 482?</p>

                <p>I am calling to ask Senator Udall to oppose the Roberts Amendment to S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act. S. 482 is about transparency. The Roberts amendment would mean a <i>less</i> transparent Senate because it would result in fewer ethics complaints being filed by nonprofit organizations.</p>

-----------------
Dear Ilan:
 

Thank you for contacting me to express your views on the issue of campaign finance reform. I appreciate you taking the time to share your opinions with me on this important issue.

 

I am a strong proponent of campaign finance reform.  Comprehensive legislation is necessary to reduce the role that money plays in our political system.  Too often, when money talks, regular people are not heard.  Only strong campaign finance reform will restore the people&#39;s control of our democracy and ensure that elected officials can spend their time serving their constituents, not raising campaign funds. 

 

In 2007, while serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, I joined Representative Dave Obey (WI) in introducing H.R. 2817, the Let the People Decide Clean Campaign Act. This legislation would have, among other things, set forth specified expenditure limitations.  It would also have established within the Department of Treasury a Grassroots Good Citizenship Fund, which would have provided funding for House candidates. Unfortunately, this commonsense legislation never came before the full House for a vote. As a U.S. Senator, I will continue to fight for strong campaign finance reform. 

 

Thank you again for contacting me to share your concerns about campaign finance reform. Be assured I will keep your thoughts in mind as I consider campaign finance reform proposals during the 111th Congress. Please feel free to contact me again on this, or any other federal issue. You may visit my website at www.tomudall.senate.gov for more information.
