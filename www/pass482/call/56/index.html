<h3>Why Oppose Roberts Amendment?</h3>
<p>At this moment, Sen. Roberts, who insists on adding an unnecessary, poison pill amendment, is blocking the bill. </p><p>The amendment proposed by Sen. Roberts would reduce accountability by requiring outside groups filing ethics complaints to reveal their sources of funding. This provision would constitute an unconstitutional burden on charities, religious bodies and non-profits attempting to ensure the operation of an honest and clean government.

    <h4>Suggested Conversation Script</h4>
    <p>I am calling to ask Senator Kyl to support S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act.
    This simple bill will ensure that senators file their campaign finance disclosure reports electronically, just like House members and Presidential candidates.</p>

    <p>Will Senator Kyl cosponsor or vote in favor of S. 482?</p>

                <p>I am calling to ask Senator Kyl to oppose the Roberts Amendment to S. 482, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act. S. 482 is about transparency. The Roberts amendment would mean a <i>less</i> transparent Senate because it would result in fewer ethics complaints being filed by nonprofit organizations.</p>

    <p>Can you tell me if he plans to oppose it? </p>

    <div class="script_item oppose_amendment_answer" id="oppose_amendment_no">

    <p>Please let Senator Kyl know that I hope he reconsiders. Voting in favor of the Roberts amendment will hurt S. 482's chances of becoming law.
    S. 482 is common sense, uncontroversial legislation that will pass as long as the Roberts Amendment fails.</p>

do not beleive that the Senator is opposing this bill.  I left my name, address, phone #

She put me on hold to ask about Kyl&#39;s position, but could not find the answer. Like the previous poster said, this seems like something they don&#39;t expect calls about or even know about, so more calls will probably be influential.
